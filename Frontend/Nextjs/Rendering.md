### Client-side Rendering (CSR)

In Client-Side Rendering (CSR) with React, the browser downloads a minimal HTML page and the JavaScript needed for the page. The JavaScript is then used to update the DOM and render the page. When the application is first loaded, the user may notice a slight delay before they can see the full page, this is because the page isn't fully rendered until all the JavaScript is downloaded, parsed, and executed.

After the page has been loaded for the first time, navigating to other pages on the same website is typically faster, as only necessary data needs to be fetched, and JavaScript can re-render parts of the page without requiring a full page refresh.

In Next.js, there are two ways you can implement client-side rendering:

1. Using React's `useEffect()` hook inside your pages instead of the server-side rendering methods ([`getStaticProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [`getServerSideProps`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/get-server-side-props)).
2. Using a data fetching library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/) to fetch data on the client (recommended).

Here's an example of using `useEffect()` inside a Next.js page:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
 
export function Page() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)
 
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`)
      }
      const result = await response.json()
      setData(result)
    }
 
    fetchData().catch((e) => {
      // handle the error as needed
      console.error('An error occurred while fetching the data: ', e)
    })
  }, [])
 
  return <p>{data ? `Your data: ${data}` : 'Loading...'}</p>
}
```

In the example above, the component starts by rendering `Loading...`. Then, once the data is fetched, it re-renders and displays the data.

Although fetching data in a `useEffect` is a pattern you may see in older React Applications, we recommend using a data-fetching library for better performance, caching, optimistic updates, and more. Here's a minimum example using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) to fetch data on the client:

```jsx
import useSWR from 'swr'
 
export function Page() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR(
    'https://api.example.com/data',
    fetcher
  )
 
  if (error) return <p>Failed to load.</p>
  if (isLoading) return <p>Loading...</p>
 
  return <p>Your Data: {data}</p>
}
```

**Good to know**:

Keep in mind that CSR can impact SEO. Some search engine crawlers might not execute JavaScript and therefore only see the initial empty or loading state of your application. It can also lead to performance issues for users with slower internet connections or devices, as they need to wait for all the JavaScript to load and run before they can see the full page. Next.js promotes a hybrid approach that allows you to use a combination of [server-side rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/server-side-rendering), [static site generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation), and client-side rendering, **depending on the needs of each page** in your application. In the App Router, you can also use [Loading UI with Suspense](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming) to show a loading indicator while the page is being rendered.


### Server-side Rendering (SSR) -  Also referred to as "SSR" or "Dynamic Rendering".

If a page uses **Server-side Rendering**, the page HTML is generated on **each request**.

To use Server-side Rendering for a page, you need to `export` an `async` function called `getServerSideProps`. This function will be called by the server on every request.

For example, suppose that your page needs to pre-render frequently updated data (fetched from an external API). You can write `getServerSideProps` which fetches this data and passes it to `Page` like below:

```jsx
export default function Page({ data }) {
  // Render data...
}
 
// This gets called on every request
export async function getServerSideProps() {
  // Fetch data from external API
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../data`)
  const data = await res.json()
 
  // Pass data to the page via props
  return { props: { data } }
}
```

As you can see, `getServerSideProps` is similar to `getStaticProps`, but the difference is that `getServerSideProps` is run on every request instead of on build time.

### Static Site Generation (SSG)

If a page uses **Static Generation**, the page HTML is generated at **build time**. That means in production, the page HTML is generated when you run `next build`. This HTML will then be reused on each request. It can be cached by a CDN.

In Next.js, you can statically generate pages **with or without data**. Let's take a look at each case.

### [Static Generation without data](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation#static-generation-without-data)

By default, Next.js pre-renders pages using Static Generation without fetching data. Here's an example:

```jsx
function About() {
  return <div>About</div>
}
 
export default About
```

Note that this page does not need to fetch any external data to be pre-rendered. In cases like this, Next.js generates a single HTML file per page during build time.

### [Static Generation with data](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation#static-generation-with-data)

Some pages require fetching external data for pre-rendering. There are two scenarios, and one or both might apply. In each case, you can use these functions that Next.js provides:

1. Your page **content** depends on external data: Use `getStaticProps`.
2. Your page **paths** depend on external data: Use `getStaticPaths` (usually in addition to `getStaticProps`).

#### [Scenario 1: Your page content depends on external data](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation#scenario-1-your-page-content-depends-on-external-data)

**Example**: Your blog page might need to fetch the list of blog posts from a CMS (content management system).

```jsx
// TODO: Need to fetch `posts` (by calling some API endpoint)
//       before this page can be pre-rendered.
export default function Blog({ posts }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

To fetch this data on pre-render, Next.js allows you to `export` an `async` function called `getStaticProps` from the same file. This function gets called at build time and lets you pass fetched data to the page's `props` on pre-render.

```jsx
export default function Blog({ posts }) {
  // Render posts...
}
 
// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()
 
  // By returning { props: { posts } }, the Blog component
  // will receive `posts` as a prop at build time
  return {
    props: {
      posts,
    },
  }
}
```

#### [Scenario 2: Your page paths depend on external data](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation#scenario-2-your-page-paths-depend-on-external-data)

Next.js allows you to create pages with **dynamic routes**. For example, you can create a file called `pages/posts/[id].js` to show a single blog post based on `id`. This will allow you to show a blog post with `id: 1` when you access `posts/1`.

**Example**: suppose that you've only added one blog post (with `id: 1`) to the database. In this case, you'd only want to pre-render `posts/1` at build time.

Later, you might add the second post with `id: 2`. Then you'd want to pre-render `posts/2` as well.

So your page **paths** that are pre-rendered depend on external data. To handle this, Next.js lets you `export` an `async` function called `getStaticPaths` from a dynamic page (`pages/posts/[id].js` in this case). This function gets called at build time and lets you specify which paths you want to pre-render.

```jsx
// This function gets called at build time
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch('https://.../posts')
  const posts = await res.json()
 
  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { id: post.id },
  }))
 
  // We'll pre-render only these paths at build time.
  // { fallback: false } means other routes should 404.
  return { paths, fallback: false }
}
```

Also in `pages/posts/[id].js`, you need to export `getStaticProps` so that you can fetch the data about the post with this `id` and use it to pre-render the page:

```jsx
export default function Post({ post }) {
  // Render post...
}
 
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // ...
}
 
// This also gets called at build time
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // params contains the post `id`.
  // If the route is like /posts/1, then params.id is 1
  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts/${params.id}`)
  const post = await res.json()
 
  // Pass post data to the page via props
  return { props: { post } }
}
```

### [When should I use Static Generation?](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation#when-should-i-use-static-generation)

We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.

You can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:

- Marketing pages
- Blog posts and portfolios
- E-commerce product listings
- Help and documentation

You should ask yourself: "Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.

On the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.

In cases like this, you can do one of the following:

- Use Static Generation with **Client-side data fetching:** You can skip pre-rendering some parts of a page and then use client-side JavaScript to populate them. To learn more about this approach, check out the [Data Fetching documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/data-fetching/client-side).
- Use **Server-Side Rendering:** Next.js pre-renders a page on each request. It will be slower because the page cannot be cached by a CDN, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date.
