## Creating and nesting components

React apps are made out of _components_. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.

React components are JavaScript functions that return markup:

```js
function MyButton() {  
return (  
	<button>I'm a button</button>  
);  
}
```

Now that you’ve declared `MyButton`, you can nest it into another component:

```jsx
export default function MyApp() {  
return (  
	<div>  
		<h1>Welcome to my app</h1>  
		<MyButton />  
	</div>  
);  

}
```

Notice that `<MyButton />` starts with a capital letter. That’s how you know it’s a React component. React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.

Have a look at the result:

```jsx
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>
      I'm a button
    </button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `export default` keywords specify the main component in the file. If you’re not familiar with some piece of JavaScript syntax, [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) and [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/import-export) have great references.

## Writing markup with JSX (Javascript Extension)

The markup syntax you’ve seen above is called _JSX_. It is optional, but most React projects use JSX for its convenience. All of the [tools we recommend for local development](https://react.dev/learn/installation) support JSX out of the box.

JSX is stricter than HTML. You have to close tags like `<br />`. Your component also can’t return multiple JSX tags. You have to wrap them into a shared parent, like a `<div>...</div>` or an empty `<>...</>` fragment or wrapper:

```jsx
function AboutPage() {  
return (  
	<>  
	<h1>About</h1>  
	<p>Hello there.<br />How do you do?</p>  
	</>  
);  
}
```

If you have a lot of HTML to port to JSX, you can use an [online converter.](https://transform.tools/html-to-jsx)

## Adding styles 

In React, you specify a CSS class with `className`. It works the same way as the HTML [`class`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/class) attribute:

```js
<img className="avatar" />
```

Then you write the CSS rules for it in a separate CSS file:

```css
.avatar {  
	border-radius: 50%;  
}
```

## Displaying data [](https://react.dev/learn#displaying-data "Link for Displaying data")

JSX lets you put markup into JavaScript. Curly braces let you “escape back” into JavaScript so that you can embed some variable from your code and display it to the user. For example, this will display `user.name`:

```jsx
return (  
	<h1>  
		{user.name}  
	</h1>  
);
```

You can also “escape into JavaScript” from JSX attributes, but you have to use curly braces _instead of_ quotes. For example, `className="avatar"` passes the `"avatar"` string as the CSS class, but `src={user.imageUrl}` reads the JavaScript `user.imageUrl` variable value, and then passes that value as the `src` attribute:

```jsx
return (  
	<img className="avatar" src={user.imageUrl} />  
);
```

You can put more complex expressions inside the JSX curly braces too, for example, [string concatenation](https://javascript.info/operators#string-concatenation-with-binary):

```jsx
const user = {
  name: 'Hedy Lamarr',
  imageUrl: 'https://i.imgur.com/yXOvdOSs.jpg',
  imageSize: 90,
};

export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{user.name}</h1>
      <img
        className="avatar"
        src={user.imageUrl}
        alt={'Photo of ' + user.name}
        style={{
          width: user.imageSize,
          height: user.imageSize
        }}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

In the above example, `style={{}}` is not a special syntax, but a regular `{}` object inside the `style={ }` JSX curly braces. You can use the `style` attribute when your styles depend on JavaScript variables.

## Conditional rendering

In React, there is no special syntax for writing conditions. Instead, you’ll use the same techniques as you use when writing regular JavaScript code. For example, you can use an [`if`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else) statement to conditionally include JSX:

```jsx
let content;  
if (isLoggedIn) {  
	content = <AdminPanel />;  
} else {  
	content = <LoginForm />;  
}  

return (  
	<div>{content}</div>  
);
```

If you prefer more compact code, you can use the [conditional `?` operator.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) Unlike `if`, it works inside JSX:

```jsx
<div>  
{isLoggedIn ? (<AdminPanel />) : (<LoginForm />)}  
</div>
```

When you don’t need the `else` branch, you can also use a shorter [logical `&&` syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND#short-circuit_evaluation):

```jsx
<div>  
{isLoggedIn && <AdminPanel />}  
</div>
```

## Rendering lists

You will rely on JavaScript features like [`for` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) and the [array `map()` function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) to render lists of components.

For example, let’s say you have an array of products:

```js
const products = [  
{ title: 'Cabbage', id: 1 },  
{ title: 'Garlic', id: 2 },  
{ title: 'Apple', id: 3 },  
];
```

Inside your component, use the `map()` function to transform an array of products into an array of `<li>` items:

```jsx
const listItems = products.map(product =>  
<li key={product.id}>  
	{product.title}  
</li>  
);  

return (  
	<ul>{listItems}</ul>  
);
```

Notice how `<li>` has a `key` attribute. For each item in a list, you should pass a string or a number that uniquely identifies that item among its siblings. Usually, a key should be coming from your data, such as a database ID. React uses your keys to know what happened if you later insert, delete, or reorder the items.

```jsx
const products = [
  { title: 'Cabbage', isFruit: false, id: 1 },
  { title: 'Garlic', isFruit: false, id: 2 },
  { title: 'Apple', isFruit: true, id: 3 },
];

export default function ShoppingList() {
  const listItems = products.map(product =>
    <li
      key={product.id}
      style={{
        color: product.isFruit ? 'magenta' : 'darkgreen'
      }}>
      {product.title}
    </li>
  );

  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
```

## Filtering arrays of items 

This data can be structured even more.

```jsx
const people = [{  
	id: 0,  
	name: 'Creola Katherine Johnson',  
	profession: 'mathematician'  
}, {  
	id: 1,  
	name: 'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez',  
	profession: 'chemist',  
}, {  
	id: 2,  
	name: 'Mohammad Abdus Salam',  
	profession: 'physicist',  
}, {  
	id: 3,  
	name: 'Percy Lavon Julian',  
	profession: 'chemist',  
}, {  
	id: 4,  
	name: 'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar',  
	profession: 'astrophysicist',  
}];
```

Let’s say you want a way to only show people whose profession is `'chemist'`. You can use JavaScript’s `filter()` method to return just those people. This method takes an array of items, passes them through a “test” (a function that returns `true` or `false`), and returns a new array of only those items that passed the test (returned `true`).

You only want the items where `profession` is `'chemist'`. The “test” function for this looks like `(person) => person.profession === 'chemist'`. Here’s how to put it together:

1. **Create** a new array of just “chemist” people, `chemists`, by calling `filter()` on the `people` filtering by `person.profession === 'chemist'`:

```js
const chemists = people.filter(person => person.profession === 'chemist');
```

```jsx
import { people } from './data.js';
import { getImageUrl } from './utils.js';

export default function List() {
  const chemists = people.filter(person => person.profession === 'chemist');
  const listItems = chemists.map(person =>
    <li>
      <img
        src={getImageUrl(person)}
        alt={person.name}
      />
      <p>
        <b>{person.name}:</b>
        {' ' + person.profession + ' '}
        known for {person.accomplishment}
      </p>
    </li>
  );
  return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
}
```

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions implicitly return the expression right after `=>`, so you didn’t need a `return` statement:

```jsx
const listItems = chemists.map(person =>  
	<li>...</li> // Implicit return!  
);
```

However, **you must write `return` explicitly if your `=>` is followed by a `{` curly brace!**

```jsx
const listItems = chemists.map(person => { // Curly brace  
	return <li>...</li>;  
});
```

Arrow functions containing `=> {` are said to have a [“block body”.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#function_body) They let you write more than a single line of code, but you _have to_ write a `return` statement yourself. If you forget it, nothing gets returned!
### Displaying several DOM nodes for each list item.

What do you do when each item needs to render not one, but several DOM nodes?

The short [`<>...</>` Fragment](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment) syntax won’t let you pass a key, so you need to either group them into a single `<div>`, or use the slightly longer and [more explicit `<Fragment>` syntax:](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment#rendering-a-list-of-fragments)

```jsx
import { Fragment } from 'react';  

const listItems = people.map(person =>  
	<Fragment key={person.id}>  
		<h1>{person.name}</h1>  
		<p>{person.bio}</p>  
	</Fragment>  
);
```

Fragments disappear from the DOM, so this will produce a flat list of `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`, and so on.

### Keeping list items in order with `key`.

```
Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique “key” prop.
```

You need to give each array item a `key` — a string or a number that uniquely identifies it among other items in that array:

```jsx
<li key={person.id}>...</li>
```

JSX elements directly inside a `map()` call always need keys!

Keys tell React which array item each component corresponds to, so that it can match them up later. This becomes important if your array items can move (e.g. due to sorting), get inserted, or get deleted. A well-chosen `key` helps React infer what exactly has happened, and make the correct updates to the DOM tree.

Rather than generating keys on the fly, you should include them in your data:
### Where to get your `key`.

Different sources of data provide different sources of keys:

- **Data from a database:** If your data is coming from a database, you can use the database keys/IDs, which are unique by nature.
- **Locally generated data:** If your data is generated and persisted locally (e.g. notes in a note-taking app), use an incrementing counter, [`crypto.randomUUID()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/randomUUID) or a package like [`uuid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) when creating items.

### Rules of keys.

- **Keys must be unique among siblings.** However, it’s okay to use the same keys for JSX nodes in _different_ arrays.
- **Keys must not change** or that defeats their purpose! Don’t generate them while rendering.

### Why does React need keys?

Imagine that files on your desktop didn’t have names. Instead, you’d refer to them by their order — the first file, the second file, and so on. You could get used to it, but once you delete a file, it would get confusing. The second file would become the first file, the third file would be the second file, and so on.

File names in a folder and JSX keys in an array serve a similar purpose. They let us uniquely identify an item between its siblings. A well-chosen key provides more information than the position within the array. Even if the _position_ changes due to reordering, the `key` lets React identify the item throughout its lifetime.

### Pitfall

You might be tempted to use an item’s *index* in the array as its key. In fact, that’s what React will use if you don’t specify a `key` at all. But the order in which you render items will change over time if an item is inserted, deleted, or if the array gets reordered. Index as a key often leads to subtle and confusing bugs.

Similarly, do not generate keys on the fly, e.g. with `key={Math.random()}`. This will cause keys to never match up between renders, leading to all your components and DOM being recreated every time. Not only is this slow, but it will also lose any user input inside the list items. Instead, use a stable ID based on the data.

Note that your components won’t receive `key` as a prop. It’s only used as a hint by React itself. If your component needs an ID, you have to pass it as a separate prop: `<Profile key={id} userId={id} />`.
## Responding to events

You can respond to events by declaring _event handler_ functions inside your components:

```jsx
function MyButton() {  

function handleClick() {  
	alert('You clicked me!');  
}  

return (  
	<button onClick={handleClick}>  
		Click me  
	</button>  
);  
}
```

Notice how `onClick={handleClick}` has no parentheses `()` at the end! Do not _call_ the event handler function: you only need to _pass it down_. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.

## Updating the screen.

Often, you’ll want your component to “remember” some information and display it. For example, maybe you want to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add _state_ to your component.

First, import [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) from React:

```js
import { useState } from 'react';
```

Now you can declare a _state variable_ inside your component:

```js
function MyButton() {  
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  

// ...
```

You’ll get two things from `useState`: the current state (`count`), and the function that lets you update it (`setCount`). You can give them any names, but the convention is to write `[something, setSomething]`.

The first time the button is displayed, `count` will be `0` because you passed `0` to `useState()`. When you want to change state, call `setCount()` and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter:

```jsx
function MyButton() {  
	const [count, setCount] = useState(0);  
	function handleClick() {  
		setCount(count + 1);  
	}  

return (  
	<button onClick={handleClick}>  
		Clicked {count} times  
	</button>  
);  
}
```

React will call your component function again. This time, `count` will be `1`. Then it will be `2`. And so on.

If you render the same component multiple times, each will get its own state. Click each button separately:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update separately</h1>
      <MyButton />
      <MyButton />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}
```

Notice how each button “remembers” its own `count` state and doesn’t affect other buttons.

## Using Hooks 

Functions starting with `use` are called _Hooks_. `useState` is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the [API reference.](https://react.dev/reference/react) You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.

Hooks are more restrictive than other functions. You can only call Hooks _at the top_ of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use `useState` in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.

## Sharing data between components [](https://react.dev/learn#sharing-data-between-components "Link for Sharing data between components")

In the previous example, each `MyButton` had its own independent `count`, and when each button was clicked, only the `count` for the button clicked changed:

![Diagram showing a tree of three components, one parent labeled MyApp and two children labeled MyButton. Both MyButton components contain a count with value zero.](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_data_child.dark.png&w=828&q=75)

Initially, each `MyButton`’s `count` state is `0`

![The same diagram as the previous, with the count of the first child MyButton component highlighted indicating a click with the count value incremented to one. The second MyButton component still contains value zero.](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_data_child_clicked.dark.png&w=828&q=75)

The first `MyButton` updates its `count` to `1`

However, often you’ll need components to _share data and always update together.

To make both `MyButton` components display the same `count` and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them.

In this example, it is `MyApp`:

![Diagram showing a tree of three components, one parent labeled MyApp and two children labeled MyButton. MyApp contains a count value of zero which is passed down to both of the MyButton components, which also show value zero.](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_data_parent.dark.png&w=828&q=75)

Initially, `MyApp`’s `count` state is `0` and is passed down to both children

![The same diagram as the previous, with the count of the parent MyApp component highlighted indicating a click with the value incremented to one. The flow to both of the children MyButton components is also highlighted, and the count value in each child is set to one indicating the value was passed down.](https://react.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fdocs%2Fdiagrams%2Fsharing_data_parent_clicked.dark.png&w=828&q=75)

On click, `MyApp` updates its `count` state to `1` and passes it down to both children

Now when you click either button, the `count` in `MyApp` will change, which will change both of the counts in `MyButton`. Here’s how you can express this in code.

### Lifting State Up

First, _move the state up_ from `MyButton` into `MyApp`:

Then, _pass the state down_ from `MyApp` to each `MyButton`, together with the shared click handler. You can pass information to `MyButton` using the JSX curly braces, just like you previously did with built-in tags like `<img>`:

The information you pass down like this is called _props_. Now the `MyApp` component contains the `count` state and the `handleClick` event handler, and _passes both of them down as props_ to each of the buttons.

Finally, change `MyButton` to _read_ the props you have passed from its parent component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function MyApp() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counters that update together</h1>
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
      <MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick} />
    </div>
  );
}

function MyButton({ count, onClick }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={onClick}>
      Clicked {count} times
    </button>
  );
}

```

When you click the button, the `onClick` handler fires. Each button’s `onClick` prop was set to the `handleClick` function inside `MyApp`, so the code inside of it runs. That code calls `setCount(count + 1)`, incrementing the `count` state variable. The new `count` value is passed as a prop to each button, so they all show the new value. This is called “lifting state up”. By moving state up, you’ve shared it between components.
