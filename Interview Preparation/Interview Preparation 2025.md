## 🧭 Step-by-Step Guide to Preparing for Senior Roles

### ✅ 1. **Master Core Tech (Java + Frameworks)**

You already know Java — now double down:

- **Java 17+**: Keep up with the latest features (records, pattern matching, switch enhancements).
    
- **Spring Boot & Spring Security**: Dive into OAuth2, JWT, and microservices with resilience.
    
- **REST + GraphQL APIs**: Design clean, scalable APIs.


**Bonus:** Dive into **Spring Cloud**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Kafka**.

---

### ✅ 2. **Get Sharp at System Design**

This is **key for senior roles**. You’ll be expected to design scalable systems.

- **Start with basics**: load balancers, sharding, caching, queues.
    
- **Practice designing**:
    
    - URL shortener
        
    - E-commerce platform
        
    - Real-time chat
        
    - Video streaming
        

📚 _Resources_:

- **Grokking the System Design Interview**
    
- **System Design Primer** on GitHub
    

---

### ✅ 3. **Level Up DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)**

Senior roles still test for problem-solving:

- Target **medium-hard** problems on LeetCode
    
- Focus on: Arrays, Hashing, Trees, Graphs, DP, Sliding Window
    

💡 Tip: Solve **1–2 DSA questions/day** and track patterns.

---

### ✅ 4. **Architectural Thinking**

- Read and understand design patterns in-depth (Factory, Strategy, Observer, etc.)
    
- Learn **hexagonal architecture**, **event-driven systems**, **CQRS**, **DDD**
    
- Think in terms of **SLAs, monitoring, logging**, and **fault-tolerance**
    

---

### ✅ 5. **Own Your DevOps Knowledge**

- Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions, Jenkins
    
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, AWS CDK)
    
- Observability: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK
    

---

### ✅ 6. **Behavioral & Leadership Prep**
