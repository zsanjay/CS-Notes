### Extract complex conditions into separate methods.
### Problem

You have a complex conditional (`if-then`/`else` or `switch`).

```java
if (date.before(SUMMER_START) || date.after(SUMMER_END)) {
  charge = quantity * winterRate + winterServiceCharge;
}
else {
  charge = quantity * summerRate;
}
```

### Solution

Decompose the complicated parts of the conditional into separate methods: the condition, `then` and `else`.

```java
if (isSummer(date)) {
  charge = summerCharge(quantity);
}
else {
  charge = winterCharge(quantity);
}
```

### Why Refactor

The longer a piece of code is, the harder it’s to understand. Things become even more hard to understand when the code is filled with conditions:

- While you’re busy figuring out what the code in the `then` block does, you forget what the relevant condition was.

- While you’re busy parsing `else`, you forget what the code in `then` does.

### Benefits

- By extracting conditional code to clearly named methods, you make life easier for the person who’ll be maintaining the code later (such as you, two months from now!).
    
- This refactoring technique is also applicable for short expressions in conditions. The string `isSalaryDay()` is much prettier and more descriptive than code for comparing dates.
    

### How to Refactor

1. Extract the conditional to a separate method via [Extract Method](https://refactoring.guru/extract-method).
2. Repeat the process for the `then` and `else` blocks.
