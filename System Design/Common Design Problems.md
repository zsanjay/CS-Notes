For any system design problem, the interviewer will be looking for a structured approach, clarity in communication, and your ability to consider trade-offs in design choices. A typical structure for these questions includes:

- **Clarification of requirements**: Understand the scope, functional, and non-functional requirements.
    
- **High-level design**: Define the system components and their interactions (databases, APIs, services, etc.).
    
- **Detailed design**: Dive deeper into individual components (e.g., database schema, caching layers, message queues).
    
- **Scalability**: Address how the system can scale, handle load, and provide reliability.
    
- **Fault tolerance**: Discuss how to ensure the system can recover from failures.
    
- **Trade-offs**: Acknowledge any trade-offs made for performance, cost, complexity, etc.
