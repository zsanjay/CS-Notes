Components often need to change what’s on the screen as a result of an interaction. Typing into the form should update the input field, clicking “next” on an image carousel should change which image is displayed, clicking “buy” should put a product in the shopping cart. Components need to “remember” things: the current input value, the current image, the shopping cart. In React, this kind of component-specific memory is called _state_.

To update a component with new data, two things need to happen:

1. **Retain** the data between renders.
2. **Trigger** React to render the component with new data (re-rendering).

The [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) Hook provides those two things:

1. A **state variable** to retain the data between renders.
2. A **state setter function** to update the variable and trigger React to render the component again.

```jsx
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);

  function handleClick() {
    setIndex(prevIndex => prevIndex + 1);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
      <p>
        {sculpture.description}
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
```

```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

> The `[` and `]` syntax here is called [array destructuring](https://javascript.info/destructuring-assignment) and it lets you read values from an array. The array returned by `useState` always has exactly two items.

### Hook

In React, `useState`, as well as any other function starting with “`use`”, is called a Hook.

_Hooks_ are special functions that are only available while React is [rendering](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit#step-1-trigger-a-render) (which we’ll get into in more detail on the next page). They let you “hook into” different React features.

#### Important Note:

**Hooks—functions starting with `use`—can only be called at the top level of your components or [your own Hooks.](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks)** You can’t call Hooks inside conditions, loops, or other nested functions. Hooks are functions, but it’s helpful to think of them as unconditional declarations about your component’s needs. You “use” React features at the top of your component similar to how you “import” modules at the top of your file.


When you call [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState), you are telling React that you want this component to remember something:

```jsx
const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
```

In this case, you want React to remember `index`.

The convention is to name this pair like `const [something, setSomething]`. You could name it anything you like, but conventions make things easier to understand across projects.

The only argument to `useState` is the **initial value** of your state variable. In this example, the `index`’s initial value is set to `0` with `useState(0)`.

Every time your component renders, `useState` gives you an array containing two values:

1. The **state variable** (`index`) with the value you stored.
2. The **state setter function** (`setIndex`) which can update the state variable and trigger React to render the component again.

1. **Your component renders the first time.** Because you passed `0` to `useState` as the initial value for `index`, it will return `[0, setIndex]`. React remembers `0` is the latest state value.
2. **You update the state.** When a user clicks the button, it calls `setIndex(index + 1)`. `index` is `0`, so it’s `setIndex(1)`. This tells React to remember `index` is `1` now and triggers another render.
3. **Your component’s second render.** React still sees `useState(0)`, but because React _remembers_ that you set `index` to `1`, it returns `[1, setIndex]` instead.
4. And so on!

### Giving a component multiple state variables 

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

It is a good idea to have multiple state variables if their state is unrelated, like `index` and `showMore` in this example. But if you find that you often change two state variables together, it might be easier to combine them into one. For example, if you have a form with many fields, it’s more convenient to have a single state variable that holds an object than state variable per field. Read [Choosing the State Structure](https://react.dev/learn/choosing-the-state-structure) for more tips.

#### How does React know which state to return? 

You might have noticed that the `useState` call does not receive any information about _which_ state variable it refers to. There is no “identifier” that is passed to `useState`, so how does it know which of the state variables to return? Does it rely on some magic like parsing your functions? The answer is no.

Instead, to enable their concise syntax, Hooks **rely on a stable call order on every render of the same component.** This works well in practice because if you follow the rule above (“only call Hooks at the top level”), Hooks will always be called in the same order. Additionally, a [linter plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-react-hooks) catches most mistakes.

Internally, React holds an array of state pairs for every component. It also maintains the current pair index, which is set to `0` before rendering. Each time you call `useState`, React gives you the next state pair and increments the index. You can read more about this mechanism in [React Hooks: Not Magic, Just Arrays.](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

This example **doesn’t use React** but it gives you an idea of how `useState` works internally:

```jsx
let componentHooks = [];
let currentHookIndex = 0;

// How useState works inside React (simplified).
function useState(initialState) {
  let pair = componentHooks[currentHookIndex];
  if (pair) {
    // This is not the first render,
    // so the state pair already exists.
    // Return it and prepare for next Hook call.
    currentHookIndex++;
    return pair;
  }

  // This is the first time we're rendering,
  // so create a state pair and store it.
  pair = [initialState, setState];

  function setState(nextState) {
    // When the user requests a state change,
    // put the new value into the pair.
    pair[0] = nextState;
    updateDOM();
  }

  // Store the pair for future renders
  // and prepare for the next Hook call.
  componentHooks[currentHookIndex] = pair;
  currentHookIndex++;
  return pair;
}

function Gallery() {
  // Each useState() call will get the next pair.
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  function handleNextClick() {
    setIndex(index + 1);
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  // This example doesn't use React, so
  // return an output object instead of JSX.
  return {
    onNextClick: handleNextClick,
    onMoreClick: handleMoreClick,
    header: `${sculpture.name} by ${sculpture.artist}`,
    counter: `${index + 1} of ${sculptureList.length}`,
    more: `${showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details`,
    description: showMore ? sculpture.description : null,
    imageSrc: sculpture.url,
    imageAlt: sculpture.alt
  };
}

function updateDOM() {
  // Reset the current Hook index
  // before rendering the component.
  currentHookIndex = 0;
  let output = Gallery();

  // Update the DOM to match the output.
  // This is the part React does for you.
  nextButton.onclick = output.onNextClick;
  header.textContent = output.header;
  moreButton.onclick = output.onMoreClick;
  moreButton.textContent = output.more;
  image.src = output.imageSrc;
  image.alt = output.imageAlt;
  if (output.description !== null) {
    description.textContent = output.description;
    description.style.display = '';
  } else {
    description.style.display = 'none';
  }
}

let nextButton = document.getElementById('nextButton');
let header = document.getElementById('header');
let moreButton = document.getElementById('moreButton');
let description = document.getElementById('description');

### State is isolated and private.

State is local to a component instance on the screen. In other words, **if you render the same component twice, each copy will have completely isolated state!** Changing one of them will not affect the other.

In this example, the `Gallery` component from earlier is rendered twice with no changes to its logic. Try clicking the buttons inside each of the galleries. Notice that their state is independent:


```jsx
import Gallery from './Gallery.js';

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <div className="Page">
      <Gallery />
      <Gallery />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This is what makes state different from regular variables that you might declare at the top of your module. State is not tied to a particular function call or a place in the code, but it’s “local” to the specific place on the screen. You rendered two `<Gallery />` components, so their state is stored separately.

Also notice how the `Page` component doesn’t “know” anything about the `Gallery` state or even whether it has any. Unlike props, **state is fully private to the component declaring it.** The parent component can’t change it. This lets you add state to any component or remove it without impacting the rest of the components.

What if you wanted both galleries to keep their states in sync? The right way to do it in React is to _remove_ state from child components and add it to their closest shared parent. The next few pages will focus on organizing state of a single component, but we will return to this topic in [Sharing State Between Components.](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components)

### Recap

- Use a state variable when a component needs to “remember” some information between renders.
- State variables are declared by calling the `useState` Hook.
- Hooks are special functions that start with `use`. They let you “hook into” React features like state.
- Hooks might remind you of imports: they need to be called unconditionally. Calling Hooks, including `useState`, is only valid at the top level of a component or another Hook.
- The `useState` Hook returns a pair of values: the current state and the function to update it.
- You can have more than one state variable. Internally, React matches them up by their order.
- State is private to the component. If you render it in two places, each copy gets its own state.

### Challenges

#### Complete the gallery [](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory#complete-the-gallery "Link for this heading")

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { sculptureList } from './data.js';

export default function Gallery() {
  const [index, setIndex] = useState(0);
  const [showMore, setShowMore] = useState(false);

  let hasPrev = index > 0;
  let hasNext = index < sculptureList.length - 1;
  
  function handleNextClick() {
    if(hasNext) {
      setIndex(index + 1);
    }
  }

  function handlePrevClick() {
    if(hasPrev) {
      setIndex(index - 1);
    }
  }

  function handleMoreClick() {
    setShowMore(!showMore);
  }

  let sculpture = sculptureList[index];
  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handlePrevClick} disabled={!hasPrev}>
        Previous
      </button>
      <button onClick={handleNextClick} disabled={!hasNext}>
        Next
      </button>
      <h2>
        <i>{sculpture.name} </i> 
        by {sculpture.artist}
      </h2>
      <h3>  
        ({index + 1} of {sculptureList.length})
      </h3>
      <button onClick={handleMoreClick}>
        {showMore ? 'Hide' : 'Show'} details
      </button>
      {showMore && <p>{sculpture.description}</p>}
      <img 
        src={sculpture.url} 
        alt={sculpture.alt}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice how `hasPrev` and `hasNext` are used _both_ for the returned JSX and inside the event handlers! This handy pattern works because event handler functions [“close over”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) any variables declared while rendering.
