### **High-Level Design (HLD) Questions**

High-Level Design questions typically ask you to define the **architecture**, **components**, and **overall structure** of a system. You’ll need to understand the key abstractions, system components, communication patterns, and technologies that will be used.

#### **1. Design a Scalable URL Shortener (e.g., Bit.ly)**

**Problem**: Design a system like Bit.ly to shorten URLs. The system should take a long URL and return a unique short URL, and when the short URL is accessed, it should redirect the user to the original URL.

**Key Considerations**:

- **Scalability**: How will you handle millions of URL shortening requests?
- **Data Storage**: How will you store mappings between short and long URLs? (Database, Key-value store, etc.)
- **Collision Handling**: What happens if two long URLs hash to the same short URL?
- **Security**: How do you handle abuse (e.g., phishing)?
- **API Design**: How would you expose the service (REST APIs, rate limiting, etc.)?

**Approach**:

- **Short URL Generation**: Use Base62 encoding to generate short URLs (i.e., a-z, A-Z, 0-9).
- **Database**: Use a **NoSQL** database like **Redis** or **MongoDB** for fast read/writes.
- **Collisions**: Handle collisions by adding a counter or using a cryptographic hash function.
- **Scalability**: To handle large numbers of requests, implement **sharding** and **replication**.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed URLs in a distributed cache (e.g., **Redis**).
- **Redirection**: Use HTTP status codes like `301` or `302` for URL redirection.

#### **2. Design a Distributed File Storage System (e.g., Google Drive, Dropbox)**

**Problem**: Design a system like Google Drive or Dropbox for storing and sharing files. The system should handle file uploads, sharing, and collaboration.

**Key Considerations**:

- **Storage**: Where will the files be stored? (Distributed storage like HDFS, S3, etc.)
- **Metadata**: How will you store metadata about files (user info, file sizes, timestamps)?
- **Scaling**: How will you scale the system to handle billions of files and users?
- **Security**: How will you ensure file security (encryption, access control)?
- **Fault Tolerance**: How will you handle failures in a distributed system?

**Approach**:

- **Storage**: Use a distributed file system (e.g., **HDFS** or **AWS S3**).
- **Metadata**: Store file metadata in a **NoSQL database** (e.g., **Cassandra**, **MongoDB**) or **relational DB** (e.g., **PostgreSQL**).
- **Security**: Encrypt files both at rest and in transit using **AES encryption** and implement **role-based access control**(RBAC).
- **Scalability**: Use **sharding** and **replication** techniques for data distribution.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Ensure high availability using **replication** and **distributed consensus** (e.g., **Zookeeper**).
- **CDN**: Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve file download speeds for global users.

#### **3. Design a Real-Time Messaging Application (e.g., WhatsApp)**

**Problem**: Design a real-time messaging system that supports text, images, and video messages. The system should handle millions of users and provide features like message encryption, read receipts, and offline message delivery.

**Key Considerations**:

- **Real-time Communication**: How will messages be delivered in real-time?
- **Scalability**: How will the system scale to handle millions of users?
- **Data Storage**: How will you store messages and media (text, images, videos)?
- **Message Queuing**: How will you ensure messages are delivered even if the recipient is offline?
- **Security**: How will you ensure that messages are secure (end-to-end encryption)?

**Approach**:

- **Communication**: Use **WebSockets** for real-time messaging, or **MQTT** for lightweight messaging in IoT-like environments.
- **Database**: Use **NoSQL databases** like **Cassandra** or **MongoDB** for storing user messages and **S3** for storing media.
- **Message Queuing**: Use **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for asynchronous message delivery, ensuring messages are delivered even when users are offline.
- **Encryption**: Use **end-to-end encryption** for messages (e.g., **AES** with public-private key pairs for encryption).
- **Scalability**: Implement **sharding**, **horizontal scaling**, and **replication** for handling large volumes of users and messages.
- **Presence**: Track online status with **Pub/Sub** models for managing presence.

#### **4. Design an E-commerce System (like Amazon)**

**Problem**: Design an e-commerce system to handle user registration, product catalogs, shopping carts, orders, and payments.

**Key Considerations**:

- **User Accounts**: How will user accounts be managed (authentication, authorization)?
- **Product Catalog**: How will product information (pricing, inventory) be stored and updated?
- **Shopping Cart**: How will the shopping cart functionality be implemented?
- **Order Processing**: How will orders be placed, processed, and tracked?
- **Payments**: How will payment processing be integrated?

**Approach**:

- **Microservices**: Use **microservices** for product catalog, user management, order processing, and payment.
- **Database**: Use **SQL** for relational data (user, orders) and **NoSQL** for product catalog or inventory.
- **Payment Integration**: Integrate with payment gateways (e.g., **Stripe**, **PayPal**) for payment processing.
- **Search**: Use **Elasticsearch** for fast and scalable product searches.
- **Scalability**: Use **load balancing** and **auto-scaling** for high traffic.
- **Event-Driven**: Use **Kafka** for order and inventory management to decouple systems and provide asynchronous processing.

### **Low-Level Design (LLD) Questions**

Low-Level Design focuses on the **implementation details** of specific components, including classes, objects, and their interactions.

#### **1. Design a Cache System (e.g., Redis)**

**Problem**: Design a basic in-memory cache system that supports basic operations like `get()`, `set()`, and `delete()`.

**Key Considerations**:

- **Data Structure**: What data structure will you use to store the cache?
- **Eviction Policies**: How will you handle cache eviction? (LRU, LFU, etc.)
- **Concurrency**: How will you handle multiple threads accessing the cache concurrently?

**Approach**:

- **Data Structure**: Use a **hash map** or **hash table** to store key-value pairs.
- **Eviction**: Implement an **LRU (Least Recently Used)** or **LFU (Least Frequently Used)** cache eviction policy.
- **Concurrency**: Use **synchronized** blocks or **locks** to ensure thread safety.
- **Expiration**: Implement **TTL (time-to-live)** for cache entries to expire after a certain period.

#### **2. Design an ATM System**

**Problem**: Design an ATM system where users can withdraw money, check balances, and transfer funds between accounts.

**Key Considerations**:

- **Account Management**: How will account information be stored and updated?
- **Concurrency**: How will you handle concurrent transactions (e.g., multiple users withdrawing from the same account)?
- **Security**: How will you secure user accounts and transactions?

**Approach**:

- **Classes**: Create classes like `ATM`, `Account`, and `Transaction`.
- **Transaction Handling**: Use **locking mechanisms** (e.g., **mutexes**) to handle concurrent withdrawals safely.
- **Security**: Use **PIN** verification and **two-factor authentication** (2FA) for user security.
- **Persistence**: Store account balances and transaction records in a **relational database**.

#### **3. Design a Voting System**

**Problem**: Design a voting system where users can cast votes for candidates, and the system needs to compute and display results.

**Key Considerations**:

- **Voting Mechanism**: How will votes be stored and counted?
- **Concurrency**: How do you ensure that votes are counted accurately without duplication?
- **Security**: How will you prevent vote tampering?

**Approach**:

- **Classes**: Define classes like `Voter`, `Candidate`, and `VotingMachine`.
- **Database**: Store votes in a **NoSQL** database (e.g., **Cassandra**) to handle large-scale voting.
- **Concurrency**: Use **optimistic concurrency control** or **locking** to ensure votes are counted correctly.
- **Security**: Implement **encryption** to ensure vote integrity and **token-based authentication** for users.
