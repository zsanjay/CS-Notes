React comes with several built-in Hooks like `useState`, `useContext`, and `useEffect`. Sometimes, you‚Äôll wish that there was a Hook for some more specific purpose: for example, to fetch data, to keep track of whether the user is online, or to connect to a chat room. You might not find these Hooks in React, but you can create your own Hooks for your application‚Äôs needs.

### Custom Hooks: Sharing logic between components:

Imagine you‚Äôre developing an app that heavily relies on the network (as most apps do). You want to warn the user if their network connection has accidentally gone off while they were using your app. How would you go about it? It seems like you‚Äôll need two things in your component:

1. A piece of state that tracks whether the network is online.
2. An Effect that subscribes to the global¬†[`online`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/online_event)¬†and¬†[`offline`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/offline_event)¬†events, and updates that state.

This will keep your component [synchronized](https://react.dev/learn/synchronizing-with-effects) with the network status. You might start with something like this:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function StatusBar() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  return <h1>{isOnline ? '‚úÖ Online' : '‚ùå Disconnected'}</h1>;
}
```


Try turning your network on and off, and notice how this `StatusBar` updates in response to your actions.

Now imagine you _also_ want to use the same logic in a different component. You want to implement a Save button that will become disabled and show ‚ÄúReconnecting‚Ä¶‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúSave‚Äù while the network is off.

To start, you can copy and paste the `isOnline` state and the Effect into `SaveButton`:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export default function SaveButton() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('‚úÖ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}
```

Verify that, if you turn off the network, the button will change its appearance.

These two components work fine, but the duplication in logic between them is unfortunate. It seems like even though they have different _visual appearance,_ you want to reuse the logic between them.

### Extracting your own custom Hook from a component.

Imagine for a moment that, similar to [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and [`useEffect`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect), there was a built-in `useOnlineStatus` Hook. Then both of these components could be simplified and you could remove the duplication between them:

```jsx
function StatusBar() {  
	const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();  
	return <h1>{isOnline ? '‚úÖ Online' : '‚ùå Disconnected'}</h1>;  
}  

function SaveButton() {  
	const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();  

	function handleSaveClick() {  
		console.log('‚úÖ Progress saved');  
	}  
  
	return (  
		<button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>  
		{isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}  
		</button>  
	);  
}
```

Although there is no such built-in Hook, you can write it yourself. Declare a function called `useOnlineStatus` and move all the duplicated code into it from the components you wrote earlier:

```jsx
function useOnlineStatus() {  
	const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);  
	useEffect(() => {  
		function handleOnline() {  
			setIsOnline(true);  
		}  
		function handleOffline() {  
			setIsOnline(false);  
		}  

	window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);  
	window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);  
	return () => {  
		window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);  
		window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);  
	};  
	}, []);  
	return isOnline;  
}
```

At the end of the function, return `isOnline`. This lets your components read that value:

#### App.js

```jsx
import { useOnlineStatus } from './useOnlineStatus.js';

function StatusBar() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
  return <h1>{isOnline ? '‚úÖ Online' : '‚ùå Disconnected'}</h1>;
}

function SaveButton() {
  const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();

  function handleSaveClick() {
    console.log('‚úÖ Progress saved');
  }

  return (
    <button disabled={!isOnline} onClick={handleSaveClick}>
      {isOnline ? 'Save progress' : 'Reconnecting...'}
    </button>
  );
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SaveButton />
      <StatusBar />
    </>
  );
}
```

Verify that switching the network on and off updates both components.

Now your components don‚Äôt have as much repetitive logic. **More importantly, the code inside them describes _what they want to do_ (use the online status!) rather than _how to do it_ (by subscribing to the browser events).**

When you extract logic into custom Hooks, you can hide the gnarly details of how you deal with some external system or a browser API. The code of your components expresses your intent, not the implementation.

### Hook names always start with¬†`use`

React applications are built from components. Components are built from Hooks, whether built-in or custom. You‚Äôll likely often use custom Hooks created by others, but occasionally you might write one yourself!

You must follow these naming conventions:

1. **React component names must start with a capital letter,**¬†like¬†`StatusBar`¬†and¬†`SaveButton`. React components also need to return something that React knows how to display, like a piece of JSX.
2. **Hook names must start with¬†`use`¬†followed by a capital letter,**¬†like¬†[`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState)¬†(built-in) or¬†`useOnlineStatus`¬†(custom, like earlier on the page). Hooks may return arbitrary values.

This convention guarantees that you can always look at a component and know where its state, Effects, and other React features might ‚Äúhide‚Äù. For example, if you see a `getColor()` function call inside your component, you can be sure that it can‚Äôt possibly contain React state inside because its name doesn‚Äôt start with `use`. However, a function call like `useOnlineStatus()` will most likely contain calls to other Hooks inside!

### Note:

If your linter is [configured for React,](https://react.dev/learn/editor-setup#linting) it will enforce this naming convention. Scroll up to the sandbox above and rename `useOnlineStatus` to `getOnlineStatus`. Notice that the linter won‚Äôt allow you to call `useState` or `useEffect` inside of it anymore. Only Hooks and components can call other Hooks!

```
## Lint Error

4:35 - React Hook "useState" is called in function "getOnlineStatus" that is neither a React function component nor a custom React Hook function. React component names must start with an uppercase letter. React Hook names must start with the word "use".
```

#### Should all functions called during rendering start with the use prefix?

No. Functions that don‚Äôt _call_ Hooks don‚Äôt need to _be_ Hooks.

If your function doesn‚Äôt call any Hooks, avoid the `use` prefix. Instead, write it as a regular function _without_ the `use` prefix. For example, `useSorted` below doesn‚Äôt call Hooks, so call it `getSorted` instead:

```jsx
// üî¥ Avoid: A Hook that doesn't use Hooks  
function useSorted(items) {  
	return items.slice().sort();  
}  

// ‚úÖ Good: A regular function that doesn't use Hooks  
function getSorted(items) {  
	return items.slice().sort();  
}
```

This ensures that your code can call this regular function anywhere, including conditions:

```jsx
function List({ items, shouldSort }) {  
	let displayedItems = items;  
	if (shouldSort) {  
		// ‚úÖ It's ok to call getSorted() conditionally because it's not a Hook  
		displayedItems = getSorted(items);  
	}  
	// ...  
}
```

You should give `use` prefix to a function (and thus make it a Hook) if it uses at least one Hook inside of it:

```jsx
// ‚úÖ Good: A Hook that uses other Hooks  
function useAuth() {  
	return useContext(Auth);  
}
```

Technically, this isn‚Äôt enforced by React. In principle, you could make a Hook that doesn‚Äôt call other Hooks. This is often confusing and limiting so it‚Äôs best to avoid that pattern. However, there may be rare cases where it is helpful. For example, maybe your function doesn‚Äôt use any Hooks right now, but you plan to add some Hook calls to it in the future. Then it makes sense to name it with the `use` prefix:

```jsx
// ‚úÖ Good: A Hook that will likely use some other Hooks later  
function useAuth() {  
	// TODO: Replace with this line when authentication is implemented:  
	// return useContext(Auth);  
	return TEST_USER;  
}
```

Then components won‚Äôt be able to call it conditionally. This will become important when you actually add Hook calls inside. If you don‚Äôt plan to use Hooks inside it (now or later), don‚Äôt make it a Hook.

### Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic, not state itself

In the earlier example, when you turned the network on and off, both components updated together. However, it‚Äôs wrong to think that a single `isOnline` state variable is shared between them. Look at this code:

```jsx
function StatusBar() { 
	const isOnline = useOnlineStatus(); 
// ...
}

function SaveButton() { 
	const isOnline = useOnlineStatus(); 
// ...
}
```

It works the same way as before you extracted the duplication:

```jsx
function StatusBar() {  
	const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);  
	useEffect(() => {  
		// ...  
	}, []);  
	// ...  
}  
  
function SaveButton() {  
	const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);  
	useEffect(() => {  
		// ...  
	}, []);  
	// ...  
}
```

These are two completely independent state variables and Effects! They happened to have the same value at the same time because you synchronized them with the same external value (whether the network is on).

To better illustrate this, we‚Äôll need a different example. Consider this `Form` component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Form() {
  const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Mary');
  const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Poppins');

  function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
    setFirstName(e.target.value);
  }

  function handleLastNameChange(e) {
    setLastName(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input value={firstName} onChange={handleFirstNameChange} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input value={lastName} onChange={handleLastNameChange} />
      </label>
      <p><b>Good morning, {firstName} {lastName}.</b></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

There‚Äôs some repetitive logic for each form field:

1. There‚Äôs a piece of state (`firstName`¬†and¬†`lastName`).
2. There‚Äôs a change handler (`handleFirstNameChange`¬†and¬†`handleLastNameChange`).
3. There‚Äôs a piece of JSX that specifies the¬†`value`¬†and¬†`onChange`¬†attributes for that input.

You can extract the repetitive logic into this `useFormInput` custom Hook:
#### App.js

```jsx
import { useFormInput } from './useFormInput.js';

export default function Form() {
  const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');
  const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        First name:
        <input {...firstNameProps} />
      </label>
      <label>
        Last name:
        <input {...lastNameProps} />
      </label>
      <p><b>Good morning, {firstNameProps.value} {lastNameProps.value}.</b></p>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### useFromInput.js

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';

export function useFormInput(initialValue) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  function handleChange(e) {
    setValue(e.target.value);
  }

  const inputProps = {
    value: value,
    onChange: handleChange
  };

  return inputProps;
}
```

Notice that it only declares _one_ state variable called `value`.

However, the `Form` component calls `useFormInput` _two times:_

```jsx
function Form() {  
	const firstNameProps = useFormInput('Mary');  
	const lastNameProps = useFormInput('Poppins');  
	// ...
```

This is why it works like declaring two separate state variables!

**Custom Hooks let you share _stateful logic_ but not _state itself._ Each call to a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook.** This is why the two sandboxes above are completely equivalent. If you‚Äôd like, scroll back up and compare them. The behavior before and after extracting a custom Hook is identical.

When you need to share the state itself between multiple components, [lift it up and pass it down](https://react.dev/learn/sharing-state-between-components) instead.

### Passing reactive values between Hooks

The code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks [need to be pure.](https://react.dev/learn/keeping-components-pure) Think of custom Hooks‚Äô code as part of your component‚Äôs body!

Because custom Hooks re-render together with your component, they always receive the latest props and state. To see what this means, consider this chat room example. Change the server URL or the chat room:

When you change `serverUrl` or `roomId`, the Effect [‚Äúreacts‚Äù to your changes](https://react.dev/learn/lifecycle-of-reactive-effects#effects-react-to-reactive-values) and re-synchronizes. You can tell by the console messages that the chat re-connects every time that you change your Effect‚Äôs dependencies.

Now move the Effect‚Äôs code into a custom Hook:

useChatRoom.js

```jsx
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId }) {  
	useEffect(() => {  
		const options = {  
		serverUrl: serverUrl,  
		roomId: roomId  
	};  
	const connection = createConnection(options);  
	connection.connect();  
	connection.on('message', (msg) => {  
		showNotification('New message: ' + msg);  
	});  
	return () => connection.disconnect();  
	}, [roomId, serverUrl]);  
}
```

This lets your `ChatRoom` component call your custom Hook without worrying about how it works inside:

ChatRoom.js

```jsx
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  
	const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  

	useChatRoom({  
		roomId: roomId,  
		serverUrl: serverUrl  
	});  

	return (  
	<>  
		<label>  
			Server URL:  
			<input value={serverUrl} onChange={e => setServerUrl(e.target.value)} />  
		</label>  
		<h1>Welcome to the {roomId} room!</h1>  
	</>  
);  
}
```

App.js

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import ChatRoom from './ChatRoom.js';

export default function App() {
  const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState('general');
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Choose the chat room:{' '}
        <select
          value={roomId}
          onChange={e => setRoomId(e.target.value)}
        >
          <option value="general">general</option>
          <option value="travel">travel</option>
          <option value="music">music</option>
        </select>
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ChatRoom
        roomId={roomId}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice how you‚Äôre taking the return value of one Hook:

```jsx
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  
	const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  
	
	useChatRoom({  
		roomId: roomId,  
		serverUrl: serverUrl  
	});  
	// ...
```

and pass it as an input to another Hook:

```jsx
export default function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  
	const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  
	
	useChatRoom({  
		roomId: roomId,  
		serverUrl: serverUrl  
	});  
	// ...
```

Every time your `ChatRoom` component re-renders, it passes the latest `roomId` and `serverUrl` to your Hook. This is why your Effect re-connects to the chat whenever their values are different after a re-render. (If you ever worked with audio or video processing software, chaining Hooks like this might remind you of chaining visual or audio effects. It‚Äôs as if the output of `useState` ‚Äúfeeds into‚Äù the input of the `useChatRoom`.)

### Passing event handlers to custom Hooks

As you start using `useChatRoom` in more components, you might want to let components customize its behavior. For example, currently, the logic for what to do when a message arrives is hardcoded inside the Hook:

```jsx
connection.on('message', (msg) => {  
	showNotification('New message: ' + msg);  
});
```

Let‚Äôs say you want to move this logic back to your component:

```jsx
onReceiveMessage(msg) {  
	showNotification('New message: ' + msg);  
}
```

To make this work, change your custom Hook to take `onReceiveMessage` as one of its named options:

```jsx
export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {  
	useEffect(() => {  
		const options = {  
			serverUrl: serverUrl,  
			roomId: roomId  
		};  
		const connection = createConnection(options);  
		connection.connect();  
		connection.on('message', (msg) => {  
			onReceiveMessage(msg);  
		});  
		return () => connection.disconnect();  
	}, [roomId, serverUrl, onReceiveMessage]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared  
}
```

This will work, but there‚Äôs one more improvement you can do when your custom Hook accepts event handlers.

Adding a dependency on `onReceiveMessage` is not ideal because it will cause the chat to re-connect every time the component re-renders. [Wrap this event handler into an Effect Event to remove it from the dependencies:](https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#wrapping-an-event-handler-from-the-props)

```jsx
import { useEffect, useEffectEvent } from 'react';  

// ...  

export function useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId, onReceiveMessage }) {  
	const onMessage = useEffectEvent(onReceiveMessage);  

	useEffect(() => {  
		const options = {  
			serverUrl: serverUrl,  
			roomId: roomId  
		};  

		const connection = createConnection(options);  
		connection.connect();  
		connection.on('message', (msg) => {  
			onMessage(msg);  
		});  
		return () => connection.disconnect();  
	}, [roomId, serverUrl]); // ‚úÖ All dependencies declared  
}
```

Now the chat won‚Äôt re-connect every time that the `ChatRoom` component re-renders. Here is a fully working demo of passing an event handler to a custom Hook that you can play with:

### When to use custom Hooks

For example, consider a `ShippingForm` component that displays two dropdowns: one shows the list of cities, and another shows the list of areas in the selected city. You might start with some code that looks like this:

```jsx
function ShippingForm({ country }) {

	const [cities, setCities] = useState(null);  
	// This Effect fetches cities for a country  
	useEffect(() => {  
		let ignore = false;  
		fetch(`/api/cities?country=${country}`)  
			.then(response => response.json())  
			.then(json => {  
				if (!ignore) {  
					setCities(json);  
				}  
				});  
				return () => {  
					ignore = true;  
				};  
	}, [country]);  
	
	const [city, setCity] = useState(null);  
	const [areas, setAreas] = useState(null);  
	// This Effect fetches areas for the selected city  
	useEffect(() => {  
		if (city) {  
			let ignore = false;  
			fetch(`/api/areas?city=${city}`)  
			.then(response => response.json())  
			.then(json => {  
				if (!ignore) {  
					setAreas(json);  
				}  
				});  
				return () => {  
					ignore = true;  
				};  
		}  
	}, [city]);  
	// ...
```

Although this code is quite repetitive, [it‚Äôs correct to keep these Effects separate from each other.](https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#is-your-effect-doing-several-unrelated-things) They synchronize two different things, so you shouldn‚Äôt merge them into one Effect. Instead, you can simplify the `ShippingForm` component above by extracting the common logic between them into your own `useData` Hook:

```jsx
function useData(url) {  
	const [data, setData] = useState(null);  
	useEffect(() => {  
		if (url) {  
			let ignore = false;  
			fetch(url).then(response => response.json())  
			.then(json => {  
				if (!ignore) {  
					setData(json);  
				}  
	});  
	return () => {  
		ignore = true;  
	};  
	}  
	}, [url]);  
	return data;  
}
```

Now you can replace both Effects in the `ShippingForm` components with calls to `useData`:

```jsx
function ShippingForm({ country }) { 
	const cities = useData(`/api/cities?country=${country}`);
	const [city, setCity] = useState(null); 
	const areas = useData(city ? `/api/areas?city=${city}` : null); 
// ...
```

Extracting a custom Hook makes the data flow explicit. You feed the `url` in and you get the `data` out. By ‚Äúhiding‚Äù your Effect inside `useData`, you also prevent someone working on the `ShippingForm` component from adding [unnecessary dependencies](https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) to it. With time, most of your app‚Äôs Effects will be in custom Hooks.

#### Keep your custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases

Start by choosing your custom Hook‚Äôs name. If you struggle to pick a clear name, it might mean that your Effect is too coupled to the rest of your component‚Äôs logic, and is not yet ready to be extracted.

Ideally, your custom Hook‚Äôs name should be clear enough that even a person who doesn‚Äôt write code often could have a good guess about what your custom Hook does, what it takes, and what it returns:

- ‚úÖ¬†`useData(url)`
- ‚úÖ¬†`useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)`
- ‚úÖ¬†`useChatRoom(options)`

When you synchronize with an external system, your custom Hook name may be more technical and use jargon specific to that system. It‚Äôs good as long as it would be clear to a person familiar with that system:

- ‚úÖ¬†`useMediaQuery(query)`
- ‚úÖ¬†`useSocket(url)`
- ‚úÖ¬†`useIntersectionObserver(ref, options)`

**Keep custom Hooks focused on concrete high-level use cases.**


Avoid creating and using custom ‚Äúlifecycle‚Äù Hooks that act as alternatives and convenience wrappers for the `useEffect` API itself:

- üî¥¬†`useMount(fn)`
- üî¥¬†`useEffectOnce(fn)`
- üî¥¬†`useUpdateEffect(fn)`

For example, this `useMount` Hook tries to ensure some code only runs ‚Äúon mount‚Äù:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  
	const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  
	// üî¥ Avoid: using custom "lifecycle" Hooks  
	useMount(() => {  
		const connection = createConnection({ roomId, serverUrl });  
		connection.connect();  

		post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat' });  
	});  
	// ...  
}  

	// üî¥ Avoid: creating custom "lifecycle" Hooks  
	function useMount(fn) {  
	 useEffect(() => {  
		fn();  
	}, []); // üî¥ React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fn'  
}
```

**Custom ‚Äúlifecycle‚Äù Hooks like `useMount` don‚Äôt fit well into the React paradigm.** For example, this code example has a mistake (it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúreact‚Äù to `roomId` or `serverUrl` changes), but the linter won‚Äôt warn you about it because the linter only checks direct `useEffect` calls. It won‚Äôt know about your Hook.

If you‚Äôre writing an Effect, start by using the React API directly:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  
	const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  
	
	// ‚úÖ Good: two raw Effects separated by purpose  
	useEffect(() => {  
		const connection = createConnection({ serverUrl, roomId });  
		connection.connect();  
		return () => connection.disconnect();  
	}, [serverUrl, roomId]);  
	
	useEffect(() => {  
		post('/analytics/event', { eventName: 'visit_chat', roomId });  
	}, [roomId]);  
	// ...  
}
```

Then, you can (but don‚Äôt have to) extract custom Hooks for different high-level use cases:

```jsx
function ChatRoom({ roomId }) {  
	const [serverUrl, setServerUrl] = useState('https://localhost:1234');  

	// ‚úÖ Great: custom Hooks named after their purpose  
	useChatRoom({ serverUrl, roomId });  
	useImpressionLog('visit_chat', { roomId });  
	// ...  
}
```

**A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining what it does.** For example, `useChatRoom(options)` can only connect to the chat room, while `useImpressionLog(eventName, extraData)` can only send an impression log to the analytics. If your custom Hook API doesn‚Äôt constrain the use cases and is very abstract, in the long run it‚Äôs likely to introduce more problems than it solves.

### Custom Hooks help you migrate to better patterns

Effects are an [‚Äúescape hatch‚Äù](https://react.dev/learn/escape-hatches): you use them when you need to ‚Äústep outside React‚Äù and when there is no better built-in solution for your use case. With time, the React team‚Äôs goal is to reduce the number of the Effects in your app to the minimum by providing more specific solutions to more specific problems. Wrapping your Effects in custom Hooks makes it easier to upgrade your code when these solutions become available.

Let‚Äôs return to this example:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleOnline() {
      setIsOnline(true);
    }
    function handleOffline() {
      setIsOnline(false);
    }
    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);
  return isOnline;
}
```

In the above example, `useOnlineStatus` is implemented with a pair of [`useState`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useState) and [`useEffect`.](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) However, this isn‚Äôt the best possible solution. There is a number of edge cases it doesn‚Äôt consider. For example, it assumes that when the component mounts, `isOnline` is already `true`, but this may be wrong if the network already went offline. You can use the browser [`navigator.onLine`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/onLine) API to check for that, but using it directly would not work on the server for generating the initial HTML. In short, this code could be improved.

Luckily, React 18 includes a dedicated API called [`useSyncExternalStore`](https://react.dev/reference/react/useSyncExternalStore) which takes care of all of these problems for you. Here is how your `useOnlineStatus` Hook, rewritten to take advantage of this new API:

```jsx
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react';

function subscribe(callback) {
  window.addEventListener('online', callback);
  window.addEventListener('offline', callback);
  return () => {
    window.removeEventListener('online', callback);
    window.removeEventListener('offline', callback);
  };
}

export function useOnlineStatus() {
  return useSyncExternalStore(
    subscribe,
    () => navigator.onLine, // How to get the value on the client
    () => true // How to get the value on the server
  );
}
```


Notice how **you didn‚Äôt need to change any of the components** to make this migration:

```jsx
function StatusBar() { 
	const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
	// ...
}

function SaveButton() {
	const isOnline = useOnlineStatus();
	// ...
}
```

This is another reason for why wrapping Effects in custom Hooks is often beneficial:

1. You make the data flow to and from your Effects very explicit.
2. You let your components focus on the intent rather than on the exact implementation of your Effects.
3. When React adds new features, you can remove those Effects without changing any of your components.

Similar to a [design system,](https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969) you might find it helpful to start extracting common idioms from your app‚Äôs components into custom Hooks. This will keep your components‚Äô code focused on the intent, and let you avoid writing raw Effects very often. Many excellent custom Hooks are maintained by the React community.

### Recap

- Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.
- Custom Hooks must be named starting with¬†`use`¬†followed by a capital letter.
- Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.
- You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay up-to-date.
- All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.
- The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component‚Äôs code.
- Wrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.
- Don‚Äôt create custom Hooks like¬†`useMount`. Keep their purpose specific.
- It‚Äôs up to you how and where to choose the boundaries of your code.

### Challenges

#### 1. Extract a¬†`useCounter`¬†Hook

This component uses a state variable and an Effect to display a number that increments every second. Extract this logic into a custom Hook called `useCounter`. Your goal is to make the `Counter` component implementation look exactly like this:
#### App.js

```jsx
import { useCounter }  from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter();
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

#### useCounter.js

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useCounter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []);
  return count;
}
```

#### 2. Make the counter delay configurable

In this example, there is a `delay` state variable controlled by a slider, but its value is not used. Pass the `delay` value to your custom `useCounter` Hook, and change the `useCounter` Hook to use the passed `delay` instead of hardcoding `1000` ms.

#### App.js

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const [delay, setDelay] = useState(1000);
  const count = useCounter(delay);
  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Tick duration: {delay} ms
        <br />
        <input
          type="range"
          value={delay}
          min="10"
          max="2000"
          onChange={e => setDelay(Number(e.target.value))}
        />
      </label>
      <hr />
      <h1>Ticks: {count}</h1>
    </>
  );
}
```

#### useCounter.js

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
    }, delay);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [delay]);
  return count;
}
```

#### 3. Extract¬†`useInterval`¬†out of¬†`useCounter`

Currently, your `useCounter` Hook does two things. It sets up an interval, and it also increments a state variable on every interval tick. Split out the logic that sets up the interval into a separate Hook called `useInterval`. It should take two arguments: the `onTick` callback, and the `delay`. After this change, your `useCounter` implementation should look like this:

App.js

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter(1000);
  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

useCounter.js

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  function onTick() {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }
  useInterval(onTick, delay);
  return count;
}
```

useInterval.js

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';

export function useInterval(onTick, delay) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, [delay, onTick]);
}
```

#### 4. Fix a resetting interval

In this example, there are _two_ separate intervals.

The `App` component calls `useCounter`, which calls `useInterval` to update the counter every second. But the `App` component _also_ calls `useInterval` to randomly update the page background color every two seconds.

For some reason, the callback that updates the page background never runs. Add some logs inside `useInterval`:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {  
	console.log('‚úÖ Setting up an interval with delay ', delay)  
	const id = setInterval(onTick, delay);  
	return () => {  
		console.log('‚ùå Clearing an interval with delay ', delay)  
		clearInterval(id);  
};  
}, [onTick, delay]);
```

Do the logs match what you expect to happen? If some of your Effects seem to re-synchronize unnecessarily, can you guess which dependency is causing that to happen? Is there some way to [remove that dependency](https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies) from your Effect?

After you fix the issue, you should expect the page background to update every two seconds.

### Solution

Inside `useInterval`, wrap the tick callback into an Effect Event, as you did [earlier on this page.](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks#passing-event-handlers-to-custom-hooks)
This will allow you to omit `onTick` from dependencies of your Effect. The Effect won‚Äôt re-synchronize on every re-render of the component, so the page background color change interval won‚Äôt get reset every second before it has a chance to fire.

With this change, both intervals work as expected and don‚Äôt interfere with each other:

##### App.js

```jsx
import { useCounter } from './useCounter.js';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export default function Counter() {
  const count = useCounter(1000);

  useInterval(() => {
    const randomColor = `hsla(${Math.random() * 360}, 100%, 50%, 0.2)`;
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = randomColor;
  }, 2000);

  return <h1>Seconds passed: {count}</h1>;
}
```

##### useInterval.js

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { experimental_useEffectEvent as useEffectEvent } from 'react';

export function useInterval(onTick, delay) {
  const onTickEffectEvent = useEffectEvent(onTick);
  useEffect(() => {
      console.log('‚úÖ Setting up an interval with delay ', delay)
    const id = setInterval(onTickEffectEvent, delay);
    return () => {
      console.log('‚ùå Clearing an interval with delay ', delay)
      clearInterval(id);
    };
  }, [delay]);
}
```

##### useCounter.js

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useInterval } from './useInterval.js';

export function useCounter(delay) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(c => c + 1);
  }, delay);
  return count;
}
```

#### 5. Implement a staggering movement

In this example, the `usePointerPosition()` Hook tracks the current pointer position. Try moving your cursor or your finger over the preview area and see the red dot follow your movement. Its position is saved in the `pos1` variable.

In fact, there are five (!) different red dots being rendered. You don‚Äôt see them because currently they all appear at the same position. This is what you need to fix. What you want to implement instead is a ‚Äústaggered‚Äù movement: each dot should ‚Äúfollow‚Äù the previous dot‚Äôs path. For example, if you quickly move your cursor, the first dot should follow it immediately, the second dot should follow the first dot with a small delay, the third dot should follow the second dot, and so on.

You need to implement the `useDelayedValue` custom Hook. Its current implementation returns the `value` provided to it. Instead, you want to return the value back from `delay` milliseconds ago. You might need some state and an Effect to do this.

After you implement `useDelayedValue`, you should see the dots move following one another.

##### App.js

```jsx
import { usePointerPosition } from './usePointerPosition.js';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useDelayedValue(value, delay) {
  const [delayedValue, setDelayedValue] = useState(value);
  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setDelayedValue(value);
    }, delay);
  }, [value, delay]);
  return delayedValue;
}

export default function Canvas() {
  const pos1 = usePointerPosition();
  const pos2 = useDelayedValue(pos1, 100);
  const pos3 = useDelayedValue(pos2, 200);
  const pos4 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 100);
  const pos5 = useDelayedValue(pos3, 50);
  return (
    <>
      <Dot position={pos1} opacity={1} />
      <Dot position={pos2} opacity={0.8} />
      <Dot position={pos3} opacity={0.6} />
      <Dot position={pos4} opacity={0.4} />
      <Dot position={pos5} opacity={0.2} />
    </>
  );
}

function Dot({ position, opacity }) {
  return (
    <div style={{
      position: 'absolute',
      backgroundColor: 'pink',
      borderRadius: '50%',
      opacity,
      transform: `translate(${position.x}px, ${position.y}px)`,
      pointerEvents: 'none',
      left: -20,
      top: -20,
      width: 40,
      height: 40,
    }} />
  );
}
```

##### usePointerPosition.js

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

export function usePointerPosition() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleMove(e) {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    }
    window.addEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('pointermove', handleMove);
  }, []);
  return position;
}
```
