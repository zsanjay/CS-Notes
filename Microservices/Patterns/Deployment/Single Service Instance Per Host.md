## Context

You have applied the [Microservice architecture pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) and architected your system as a set of services. Each service is deployed as a set of service instances for throughput and availability.

## Problem

How are services packaged and deployed?

## Forces [§](https://microservices.io/patterns/deployment/single-service-per-host.html#forces)

- Services are written using a variety of languages, frameworks, and framework versions
- Each service consists of multiple service instances for throughput and availability
- Service must be independently deployable and scalable
- Service instances need to be isolated from one another
- You need to be able to quickly build and deploy a service
- You need to be able to constrain the resources (CPU and memory) consumed by a service
- You need to monitor the behavior of each service instance
- You want deployment to reliable
- You must deploy the application as cost-effectively as possible

## Solution

Deploy each single service instance on its own host

## Examples

## Resulting context

The benefits of this approach include:

- Services instances are isolated from one another
- There is no possibility of conflicting resource requirements or dependency versions
- A service instance can only consume at most the resources of a single host
- Its straightforward to monitor, manage, and redeploy each service instance

The drawbacks of this approach include:

- Potentially less efficient resource utilization compared to [Multiple Services per Host](https://microservices.io/patterns/deployment/multiple-services-per-host.html) because there are more hosts
