Run multiple instances of different services on a host (Physical or Virtual machine).

There are various ways of deploying a service instance on a shared host including:

- Deploy each service instance as a JVM process. For example, a Tomcat or Jetty instances per service instance.
- Deploy multiple service instances in the same JVM. For example, as web applications or OSGI bundles.

## Examples

## Resulting context

The benefits of this pattern include:

- More efficient resource utilization than theÂ [Service Instance per host pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/deployment/single-service-per-host.html)

The drawbacks of this approach include:

- Risk of conflicting resource requirements
- Risk of conflicting dependency versions
- Difficult to limit the resources consumed by a service instance
- If multiple services instances are deployed in the same process then its difficult to monitor the resource consumption of each service instance. Its also impossible to isolate each instance
