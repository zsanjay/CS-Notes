Package the service as a virtual machine image and deploy each service instance as a separate VM

## Examples

- Netflix packages each service as an EC2 AMI and deploys each service instance as a EC2 instance.

## Resulting context

The benefits of this approach include:

- Its straightforward to scale the service by increasing the number of instances. Amazon Autoscaling Groups can even do this automatically based on load.
- The VM encapsulates the details of the technology used to build the service. All services are, for example, started and stopped in exactly the same way.
- Each service instance is isolated
- A VM imposes limits on the CPU and memory consumed by a service instance
- IaaS solutions such as AWS provide a mature and feature rich infrastructure for deploying and managing virtual machines. For example,
    - Elastic Load Balancer -
    - Autoscaling groups
    - â€¦

The drawbacks of this approach include:

- Building a VM image is slow and time consuming
