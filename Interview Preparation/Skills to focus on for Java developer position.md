A senior developer is expected to have hands-on experience with key Java frameworks and libraries, such as:

- **Spring Framework**:
    - **Spring Core**, **Spring Boot**, **Spring Data**, **Spring MVC**, and **Spring Security**.
    - In-depth knowledge of **dependency injection**, **aspect-oriented programming (AOP)**, and **transaction management**.
    - Building RESTful services with **Spring Web** and understanding **Spring Cloud** for microservices.
- **Hibernate / JPA**:
    - Deep understanding of **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)**, **JPQL**, **Criteria API**, and performance optimizations.
    - Working with complex mappings, transactions, caching, and lazy vs. eager loading.
- **Test Frameworks**:
    - Unit testing with **JUnit 5** and **Mockito**.
    - Integration testing, test-driven development (TDD), and understanding of mocking, stubbing, and assertions.

### 4. **Design Patterns and Architecture**

As a senior developer, you'll need to know how to design maintainable, scalable, and flexible systems. This includes:

- **Design Patterns**:
    - Creational (Factory, Singleton, Builder), Structural (Adapter, Decorator, Proxy), and Behavioral (Strategy, Observer, Command, Template Method).
    - Understanding the **SOLID principles** and applying them in the context of Java.
- **Software Architecture**:
    - Experience with **Layered Architecture**, **Microservices**, **Monolithic**, and **Event-Driven Architectures**.
    - Knowledge of **CQRS**, **Event Sourcing**, and **CAP Theorem** for distributed systems.
    - Familiarity with **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and how to break down a complex system into manageable subdomains.

### 5. **Performance Optimization**

Performance is often a concern in enterprise-level Java applications, so being able to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks is critical.

- **JVM Internals**:
    - Understanding how the JVM works, including garbage collection (GC), memory management, and how to analyze JVM logs.
    - Using **Java profiling tools** like **JVisualVM**, **JProfiler**, **YourKit** for memory leaks, CPU bottlenecks, thread dumps, etc.
    - Optimizing **database queries** and using **caching** (e.g., **Ehcache**, **Redis**).
- **Concurrency Optimization**:
    - Knowledge of **concurrent collections**, **locking mechanisms** (`ReentrantLock`, `ReadWriteLock`), and avoiding contention.
- **Scalability**:
    - Horizontal scaling (distributed systems, load balancing) and vertical scaling (better hardware usage).
    - Using tools like **Kafka** or **RabbitMQ** for message-driven architecture and event-driven solutions.

### 6. **Databases and SQL**

- **Relational Databases**:
    - Advanced SQL querying (joins, subqueries, indexes, transactions, stored procedures, etc.).
    - Performance optimization for SQL queries, understanding of **ACID properties**, and **database design**.
- **NoSQL Databases**:
    - Familiarity with **NoSQL databases** like **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, **Redis**, **Elasticsearch**, and understanding where to use them vs. relational databases.

### 7. **Version Control & Build Tools**

- **Version Control**: Strong knowledge of **Git** (branching, merging, rebasing, etc.), as it’s crucial for collaboration in large teams.
- **Build and CI/CD**: Experience with **Maven**, **Gradle**, and **Jenkins** for automating builds, running tests, and deploying code.

### 8. **Cloud and Deployment**

As many companies move to cloud-based architectures, you should be familiar with:

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure.
- **Containerization**: Experience with **Docker** and **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Familiarity with automated pipelines (using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI) for deployment automation.

### 9. **Security**

As a senior developer, you must be aware of best practices in software security, including:

- Secure coding practices (e.g., avoiding SQL injection, XSS, CSRF).
- **Authentication** and **Authorization**: Experience with OAuth, JWT, and **Spring Security**.
- Data encryption and secure communication (SSL/TLS).

### 10. **Soft Skills and Leadership**

- **Problem Solving**: Ability to break down complex problems and provide elegant solutions.
- **Leadership and Mentoring**: Experience leading teams, reviewing code, providing feedback, and mentoring junior developers.
- **Communication Skills**: Ability to communicate technical concepts clearly to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Collaboration**: Ability to work well in a team, especially in agile development environments.

### 11. **Optional/Advanced Skills**

### Conclusion

A **Senior Java Developer** should have a well-rounded skillset, combining deep knowledge of Java and associated technologies with a broad understanding of system design, performance, and cloud technologies. Focus on mastering both the theoretical aspects (algorithms, design patterns) and practical aspects (frameworks, databases, performance optimization) while also developing leadership and problem-solving skills to effectively contribute in large, complex projects.
