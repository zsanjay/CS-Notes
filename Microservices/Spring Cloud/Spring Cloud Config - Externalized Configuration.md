## Problem

How to enable a service to run in multiple environments without modification?

## [Forces](https://microservices.io/patterns/externalized-configuration.html#forces)

- A service must be provided with configuration data that tells it how to connect to the external/3rd party services. For example, the database network location and credentials
- A service must run in multiple environments - dev, test, qa, staging, production - without modification and/or recompilation
- Different environments have different instances of the external/3rd party services, e.g. QA database vs. production database, test credit card processing account vs. production credit card processing account

## Solution

Externalize all application configuration including the database credentials and network location. On startup, a service reads the configuration from an external source, e.g. OS environment variables, etc.

## Resulting Context

This pattern has the following benefits:

- The application runs in multiple environments without modification and/or recompilation

There are the following issues with this pattern:

- How to ensure that when an application is deployed the supplied configuration matches what is expected?


Spring Cloud Config provides server-side and client-side support for externalized configuration in a distributed system. With the Config Server, you have a central place to manage external properties for applications across all environments. The concepts on both client and server map identically to the Spring `Environment` and `PropertySource` abstractions, so they fit very well with Spring applications but can be used with any application running in any language. As an application moves through the deployment pipeline from dev to test and into production, you can manage the configuration between those environments and be certain that applications have everything they need to run when they migrate. The default implementation of the server storage backend uses git, so it easily supports labelled versions of configuration environments as well as being accessible to a wide range of tooling for managing the content. It is easy to add alternative implementations and plug them in with Spring configuration.

# Spring Cloud Config Server

Spring Cloud Config Server provides an HTTP resource-based API for external configuration (name-value pairs or equivalent YAML content). The server is embeddable in a Spring Boot application, by using the `@EnableConfigServer` annotation. Consequently, the following application is a config server:

ConfigServer.java

```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableConfigServer
public class ConfigServer {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication.run(ConfigServer.class, args);
  }
}
```

Like all Spring Boot applications, it runs on port 8080 by default, but you can switch it to the more conventional port 8888 in various ways. The easiest, which also sets a default configuration repository, is by launching it with `spring.config.name=configserver` (there is a `configserver.yml` in the Config Server jar). Another is to use your own `application.properties`, as shown in the following example:

application.properties

```properties
server.port: 8888
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri: file://${user.home}/config-repo
```

where `${user.home}/config-repo` is a git repository containing YAML and properties files.
