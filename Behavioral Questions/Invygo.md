---

### **Summary of Day-to-Day Responsibilities**:

- **Design and implement features**.
- **Mentor junior engineers** and conduct **code reviews**.
- **Collaborate with cross-functional teams** (Product, Design, etc.).
- **Lead and own projects**, making high-level technical decisions.
- **Contribute to best practices** and improve team processes.
- **Optimize systems** for performance, scalability, and reliability.
- **Communicate with stakeholders** and provide technical clarity.
- **Stay updated with new technologies** and best practices.

- **How do you prioritize your tasks and manage your time?**

"To prioritize my tasks, I start by aligning with the team’s and business’s goals. I break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable ones and use frameworks like the **Eisenhower Matrix** to determine what’s urgent and important.
I rely on tools like **Jira** to track tasks and progress, and I try to allocate specific blocks of time in my calendar for focused, deep work. 
Communication is key for me, so I regularly check in with stakeholders to make sure my priorities are in line with the team’s goals.
I also delegate tasks when appropriate, ensuring that I can focus on high-impact work, such as system design and tackling complex challenges. Finally, I review my priorities regularly and stay flexible when new challenges or deadlines arise."

- **Can you describe a time when you had to make a tough technical decision?** 

Bottleneck when using single db, all the reads and writes are happening from the same db. Solution is to implement a CQRS pattern, which will separate reads from writes, which results to faster response to the user about 30% reduction in the latency of the response.

"In a previous project, we were tasked with scaling a legacy system to support a rapidly growing user base. The system was a monolithic architecture that struggled with performance bottlenecks, particularly around data retrieval. I had to decide whether to refactor the monolith or migrate to a microservices architecture. After gathering input from stakeholders and evaluating the trade-offs, I decided that moving to microservices would be the best long-term solution despite the initial investment in time and resources. We took an incremental approach to migration, starting with critical services and gradually moving others over. The decision ultimately allowed the system to scale efficiently, though we faced challenges in service communication and data consistency. We overcame these by introducing a strong API gateway and automated testing early in the process, and after a year, the system supported a much larger user base with better performance and scalability."

- **How do you mentor junior engineers?**

"When mentoring junior engineers, I focus on creating a supportive, hands-on environment where they can learn by doing. I begin by setting clear expectations and helping them break down tasks into manageable pieces. I regularly conduct **code reviews**, offering constructive feedback, and I encourage them to **experiment** and **ask questions** so they can learn independently. I make sure to pair program with them on challenging tasks, and I encourage them to take ownership of smaller features or tasks. We also have regular one-on-one meetings to discuss their career goals and progress. Ultimately, I aim to help them grow into independent, confident engineers while supporting their technical and professional development."


- **Can you provide an example of a system you designed and what challenges you faced?**

Designing a system for generating **video benefit statements** in a **serverless architecture** using **AWS** brings unique challenges, especially around **throttling**, as serverless systems are often subject to resource limits, scaling behavior, and performance constraints. The goal here is to ensure that the system can **handle varying loads efficiently** without throttling, and that it can **scale on-demand** without overwhelming any part of the system.

### **Situation:**

You are tasked with building a **server less** solution for generating **video benefit statements** for users. These video statements are personalized videos that highlight user benefits, policies, and other relevant details, likely requiring heavy **media processing**, **data aggregation**, and **third-party integrations**. The challenge is to design this system in such a way that it can **scale** for thousands of concurrent requests, while avoiding **throttling issues** that might arise due to AWS limits and service rate limits.

### **Key Challenges with Throttling in Server less Architectures:**

1. **AWS Lambda Concurrency Limits**: AWS Lambda has **concurrency limits**, which dictate how many functions can run simultaneously. If there is a burst of requests, Lambda functions might get throttled, leading to **delays** or **timeouts**.
    
2. **API Gateway Rate Limits**: AWS API Gateway, which you might use for front-end communication, has **throttling settings** (rate limits for requests). If too many requests (429) come in within a short period, API Gateway can throttle the incoming requests, leading to **502 errors** or **rate limiting responses**.
    
3. **Step Functions Workflow Throttling**: If you're using **AWS Step Functions** to orchestrate complex workflows (e.g., video generation, data fetching, and personalization), throttling may occur if the workflow executes too many tasks in parallel or exceeds state transition limits.
    
4. **DynamoDB Provisioned Throughput**: If you're using **DynamoDB** for storing user data or video metadata, you may encounter **read/write throttling** if the provisioned throughput limits are exceeded (if you're using provisioned mode), or if the system is overwhelmed with large numbers of read or write requests (even on the **on-demand mode**).
    
5. **Third-party API Limits**: Video generation may involve calling third-party APIs (Idomoo) for video rendering, which could have rate limits or processing time constraints.

### **How to Address Throttling and Design a Scalable Solution:**

Here’s how you can design the **video benefit statement generation system** using **AWS server less architecture** and mitigate throttling issues:

---

### **1. Use AWS Lambda with Reserved Concurrency:**

To prevent your Lambda functions from being throttled during peak times, you can configure **reserved concurrency**. This ensures that a specific number of Lambda instances will always be available to handle incoming requests, preventing any throttling due to concurrent execution limits.

- **Action**:
    - Set **reserved concurrency** for your video processing Lambda functions to ensure that a dedicated pool of Lambda functions is always available.
    - Use **Lambda Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)** to handle cases where Lambda is unable to process requests due to throttling or failures.

> **Example**: If your system processes 10,000 requests per day, and you anticipate 1,000 concurrent requests during peak times, you could configure **reserved concurrency** to handle 1,000 simultaneous invocations. Ensure that the Lambda function is optimized and can process the request efficiently.

---

### **2. Rate Limiting and Request Queuing with SQS:**

If you're anticipating bursts of traffic or high concurrency, implementing a **queue-based architecture** with **Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)** can help prevent throttling by controlling the flow of requests.

- **Action**:
    - Use **Amazon SQS** to queue incoming requests and have **Lambda functions** process them asynchronously, thus **decoupling** the ingestion of requests from processing.
    - You can also apply **SQS delay queues** to introduce a controlled delay in request processing, preventing immediate overload of resources.
    - Set an **SQS visibility timeout** to avoid message duplication if processing fails or Lambda is throttled.

> **Example**: Instead of calling a Lambda function directly via API Gateway, the incoming video request would be placed in an SQS queue. Multiple Lambda functions can then poll and process the requests asynchronously, avoiding sudden spikes in traffic that could overwhelm the system.

---

### **3. API Gateway Throttling and Caching:**

If you're using **AWS API Gateway** for user-facing endpoints, you can configure **rate limiting and burst capacity** to handle varying load and prevent throttling.

- **Action**:
    - Use **API Gateway throttling** to limit the number of requests per second (e.g., 500 requests per second, with bursts of up to 1,000). This can smooth out traffic spikes and prevent overwhelming your backend services.
    - Enable **API Gateway caching** to reduce the number of calls to the backend for repeated requests. For example, caching the results of video generation metadata can reduce load on downstream services like Lambda or third-party APIs.

> **Example**: If users frequently generate benefit videos for the same types of policies, you can cache the result (e.g., video metadata) for a specified period (e.g., 24 hours). This would avoid multiple requests for the same data, reducing API Gateway throttling and speeding up user interactions.

---

### **4. AWS Step Functions for Orchestrating Video Processing Workflows:**

For complex workflows, you can use **AWS Step Functions** to sequence Lambda executions for video generation. This allows you to control concurrency and retry logic without overwhelming any specific step in the process.

- **Action**:
    - Use **Step Functions' parallel states** for independent tasks (like processing video data and querying user information) and control the maximum concurrency within each state to avoid throttling.
    - Implement **retry logic** in your Step Functions state machine to handle temporary failures and rate limits from downstream services (like video processing APIs).

> **Example**: Suppose your video generation involves multiple steps (e.g., fetching user data, rendering the video, and uploading to S3). Step Functions allow you to configure each step with appropriate retries, timeouts, and concurrency limits, ensuring that your system doesn’t overload and that failures are handled gracefully.

---

### **5. DynamoDB Throttling Prevention with Auto Scaling:**

If you use **DynamoDB** for storing user metadata or video details, DynamoDB’s **auto-scaling feature** can dynamically adjust the read and write throughput to accommodate fluctuating workloads and prevent throttling.

- **Action**:
    - Use **DynamoDB on-demand mode** if you expect unpredictable access patterns, so you don’t have to manually adjust provisioned throughput.
    - Alternatively, if you use **provisioned mode**, configure **auto-scaling** for read and write capacity based on the incoming traffic.

> **Example**: If your system experiences varying demand (e.g., high traffic during certain hours), enabling **auto-scaling** for DynamoDB ensures that your database can automatically scale up or down without hitting read/write throttling limits.

---

### **6. Handling Third-Party API Throttling with Circuit Breakers:**

If your system integrates with external APIs (for video rendering, payment, etc.), you must consider their rate limits. Use a **circuit breaker pattern** to handle rate-limiting from third-party APIs gracefully.

- **Action**:
    - Implement a **circuit breaker** to stop calling third-party APIs if their rate limits are exceeded, and apply **retry mechanisms** with **exponential backoff**.
    - Monitor API usage and implement **rate-limiting** or **request queues** to ensure you're not exceeding the limits.

> **Example**: If you’re calling a third-party video rendering service, and it has a limit of 100 requests per minute, the circuit breaker will prevent further requests when that limit is reached. After a delay, the circuit breaker will allow retrying once the service is available.

---

### **Final System Architecture Overview:**

6. **API Gateway** to handle incoming requests from users.
7. **SQS Queue** to decouple requests and manage load, ensuring no overwhelming of downstream services.
8. **Lambda Functions** for processing requests and generating the benefit video.
9. **DynamoDB** (with auto-scaling) or **S3** for storing user data and video files.
10. **Step Functions** for orchestrating the video generation workflow, controlling concurrency.
11. **Third-party API Integration** with circuit breakers and retry mechanisms to handle rate limits from external services.

---

### **Example Solution Design Recap:**

> To mitigate throttling in the server less architecture for the video benefit statement generation, we used **SQS** to queue incoming requests, decoupling them from processing. **AWS Lambda** was configured with **reserved concurrency** to handle peak traffic, while **API Gateway throttling** ensured that users weren't overwhelmed with too many requests. For complex workflows, we used **AWS Step Functions** with controlled concurrency to orchestrate tasks. We also relied on **DynamoDB auto-scaling** and **circuit breakers** for third-party APIs to avoid rate limit issues. As a result, the system could handle significant spikes in traffic without encountering throttling or failures.


- **How do you handle technical debt in a project?**

Handling **technical debt** is an important aspect of maintaining the long-term health of a project. As projects evolve, it's easy to accumulate shortcuts, temporary solutions, and suboptimal decisions that might work in the short term but can cause problems down the road. As a senior engineer, it’s your responsibility to manage this debt in a way that doesn’t derail progress but also ensures the system remains maintainable and scalable.

Here’s a structured approach to handling **technical debt**:

---

### 1. **Acknowledge the Debt**

**Situation**: One of the first steps is to recognize that technical debt exists. Often, technical debt accumulates because of **quick fixes**, **tight deadlines**, or when the system needs to evolve faster than anticipated.

- **Action**: Regularly **audit the codebase** and **assess the architecture** to identify areas where debt is accumulating. Pay attention to areas like:
    - **Code duplication**.
    - **Hardcoded values**.
    - **Poor test coverage**.
    - **Scalability issues**.
    - **Suboptimal performance**.

- **Example**: "We realized that our legacy authentication system had accumulated significant debt due to last-minute changes to meet a launch deadline. The code was difficult to maintain, and some authentication methods were no longer secure or efficient."

---

### 2. **Prioritize the Debt**

**Situation**: Not all technical debt is created equal. Some will have a bigger impact on the project’s performance, security, or maintainability than others.

- **Action**:
    
    - **Assess impact**: Identify which parts of the debt are causing the most immediate issues (e.g., performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, or high maintenance cost).
    - **Prioritize by severity**: Create a priority list of debts to address, based on factors like impact on the product, security risks, or business goals.
    - **Balance with new features**: Balance paying down technical debt with new features and functionality. Too much focus on debt can delay business-critical features, while focusing only on features can make technical debt even worse.

- **Example**: "In one project, we realized the primary issue was with the authentication module, which was insecure. That took precedence over refactoring some legacy business logic. We fixed the security issue, and only then did we tackle the other debts."
    

---

### 3. **Refactor Iteratively**

**Situation**: Refactoring the entire codebase in one go is usually not feasible or practical, especially when the project is live.

- **Action**:
    - **Small incremental changes**: Make **small, manageable changes** over time. Every time you’re working on a feature or bug fix, try to improve the code quality incrementally.
    - **Refactor in parallel**: Refactor parts of the system that are actively being worked on to avoid adding more debt.
    - **Use feature flags**: When refactoring large components, consider using **feature flags** to deploy changes incrementally while still testing and monitoring.
- **Example**: "We decided to start refactoring the legacy authentication system by moving from monolithic logic to a more modular approach. Each sprint, we replaced one or two parts of the system, ensuring the rest of the application continued to function as expected."

---

### 4. **Technical Debt as Part of the Workflow**

**Situation**: It’s easy to let technical debt pile up when it's seen as a secondary concern. To prevent that from happening, it’s essential to make **managing technical debt** a continuous part of the development process.

- **Action**:
    
    - **Incorporate debt management into sprints**: Set aside dedicated time for addressing technical debt in every sprint or release cycle.
    - **Allocate debt paydown as part of the backlog**: Treat technical debt like any other task in the backlog, prioritizing it as part of regular product development.
    - **Encourage a culture of quality**: Foster a team culture where **maintaining code quality** is a shared responsibility.
    - **Create coding standards**: Use linting tools, code reviews, and automated testing to prevent new debt from accumulating in the first place.
- **Example**: "We implemented a policy where every two weeks we dedicate 10% of the sprint to improving code quality and paying down technical debt. This was well-received, as it allowed the team to continuously improve the codebase without blocking other priorities."
    

---

### 5. **Automate and Use Tools for Debt Detection**

**Situation**: Identifying technical debt manually can be time-consuming, especially in large systems. Automating this process can help you detect debt faster and reduce the human cost of managing it.

- **Action**:
    
    - Use **static analysis tools** (like SonarQube, ESLint, or Pylint) to identify common code smells and potential sources of technical debt.
    - Implement **continuous integration (CI)** and **continuous delivery (CD)** pipelines to run these checks automatically on every commit.
    - Set up **monitoring and logging** to track system performance, identifying areas where debt may be negatively affecting speed or user experience.
- **Example**: "We integrated **SonarQube** into our CI pipeline to automatically flag issues like code duplication, low test coverage, and security vulnerabilities. This gave us immediate visibility into areas that needed improvement, and we acted on these issues incrementally."
    

---

### 6. **Review and Refactor Legacy Code**

**Situation**: Legacy systems often accumulate the most debt. Refactoring or rewriting legacy systems can be daunting, but it’s necessary for long-term sustainability.

- **Action**:
    
    - **Rewrite incrementally**: Instead of a complete rewrite, refactor legacy code gradually as part of regular feature development. This minimizes risk and allows the system to remain functional.
    - **Write tests**: Before refactoring, ensure that you have sufficient **unit tests** or **integration tests** in place to ensure you don’t break existing functionality.
    - **Document well**: Ensure that changes are well-documented, so future developers can easily understand the decisions made during refactoring.
- **Example**: "When working with a legacy monolith, we implemented a **microservices architecture** incrementally. We rewrote small, independent components, testing each part thoroughly before deployment. Over time, we migrated the entire system without causing major disruptions."
    

---

### 7. **Track and Communicate Progress**

**Situation**: Without tracking progress, it’s hard to know if you're addressing technical debt effectively or if it’s becoming a bigger issue.

- **Action**:
    
    - **Track debt reduction**: Create metrics (e.g., code complexity, test coverage, code smells, build time) and track them over time to monitor the progress of paying down technical debt.
    - **Report regularly**: Communicate the status of technical debt to stakeholders, making sure they understand the importance of addressing debt for the long-term health of the project.
    - **Celebrate improvements**: When significant technical debt is addressed, share the improvements with the team and stakeholders. This reinforces the value of addressing debt proactively.
- **Example**: "We created a **technical debt tracker** that showed how much of our backlog was related to technical debt. This helped the product team understand the trade-offs between new features and maintaining the system. We also created monthly reports to show progress."
    

---

### **Summary:**

1. **Acknowledge and Identify**: Regularly audit the code and system for technical debt.
2. **Prioritize**: Address high-impact debt that affects security, performance, or maintainability first.
3. **Refactor Iteratively**: Tackle technical debt in small increments, focusing on one area at a time.
4. **Integrate into Workflow**: Make addressing technical debt part of your regular development process.
5. **Automate**: Use tools and CI pipelines to help identify and track technical debt.
6. **Address Legacy Systems**: Gradually refactor legacy systems with good test coverage.
7. **Track Progress**: Continuously track debt and communicate progress to stakeholders.


- **What is your approach to code reviews?**

My approach to **code reviews** is focused on fostering **collaboration**, ensuring **code quality**, and promoting **continuous learning** within the team. It’s important to create a supportive environment where feedback is constructive and everyone feels comfortable asking questions or seeking help.

Here’s a breakdown of how I approach **code reviews**:

---

### 1. **Focus on the Purpose and Context**

**Before reviewing the code, I try to understand the context and purpose of the change**. This means reviewing the **issue or task** the code is trying to solve and the **requirements** behind the change. I also make sure to check for any design or architectural decisions made during development.

- **Questions I ask myself**:
    
    - What problem is this code trying to solve?
    - Does the solution align with the original requirements?
    - Are there any **edge cases** or **requirements** I should be aware of?
    - Is the solution scalable and maintainable for the long term?
- **Example**: "If the code is adding a feature to support user notifications, I want to ensure that it handles cases like failed delivery, retries, and failure scenarios."
    

---

### 2. **Check for Code Quality and Readability**

Code should not only work but should be **easy to read, understand, and maintain**. I prioritize **clean code** and **clarity**over cleverness or excessive optimization.

- **Key things I look for**:
    
    - **Clarity**: Is the code easy to understand? Are variables and functions named meaningfully?
    - **Consistency**: Does the code follow the project's **coding standards** and **style guides** (e.g., naming conventions, indentation, formatting)?
    - **Simplicity**: Is the code as simple as possible to achieve the desired result? Does it avoid unnecessary complexity?
    - **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**: Are there any opportunities to avoid repetition by abstracting common logic into reusable functions or components?
    - **Modularity**: Are there functions or classes that can be extracted to improve reusability and separation of concerns?
- **Example**: "Instead of writing inline complex logic within the function, I suggest extracting that logic into a helper function to make the main function easier to read."
    

---

### 3. **Ensure Proper Testing**

I always check if the code includes sufficient **tests** to verify its correctness. Code should be covered by **unit tests**, **integration tests**, or **end-to-end tests**, depending on the nature of the change.

- **Things I look for**:
    
    - **Test Coverage**: Does the code have tests for the happy path and edge cases? Are there tests for potential failure scenarios?
    - **Test Quality**: Are the tests meaningful and easy to understand? Do they test the actual behavior of the code and not just the implementation details?
    - **Automated Testing**: Does the code pass all existing and new tests in the CI/CD pipeline?
- **Example**: "I see that we’ve added a new function, but we don’t have tests to check how it behaves with invalid input. I recommend adding tests to cover those edge cases."
    

---

### 4. **Look for Performance and Optimization**

I check for any potential **performance issues**, especially if the change could introduce inefficient operations or increase resource usage (e.g., slow queries, heavy loops, excessive API calls).

- **Questions I ask myself**:
    
    - Are there any **performance bottlenecks** (e.g., unnecessary loops, repeated database queries)?
    - Does the code introduce any **resource leaks** (e.g., unclosed files, unhandled exceptions)?
    - Are there any opportunities for **optimization**, especially when scaling up?
- **Example**: "In the current implementation, we’re making multiple database queries within a loop. It would be more efficient to batch these queries or perform them outside the loop."

### 5. **Check for Security Concerns**

Security is a top priority, and I always verify if the code is **secure** and doesn’t introduce vulnerabilities.

- **Security checks I look for**:
    
    - **Input validation**: Are all user inputs validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS)?
    - **Authentication & Authorization**: Are we checking that the user has proper permissions before performing sensitive operations?
    - **Data encryption**: Are we encrypting sensitive data (e.g., passwords, tokens) both in transit and at rest?
    - **Error handling**: Are errors handled properly without exposing sensitive information?
- **Example**: "The API endpoint you implemented accepts user input directly into a SQL query. I recommend using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks."

### 6. **Encourage Collaboration and Feedback**

Code reviews are not just about finding bugs — they're about **collaboration and learning**. I try to ensure that the review process is **constructive** and **collaborative**.

- **How I ensure this**:
    
    - **Be respectful and supportive**: Acknowledge the effort that went into the code and be mindful that reviews should help people improve.
    - **Ask questions**: If something is unclear, I ask questions instead of making assumptions. This opens up a dialogue and can help us reach better solutions.
    - **Offer suggestions**: I offer alternative solutions or approaches when applicable, but I always explain why I think one approach might be better than another.
- **Example**: "I noticed you're using a `for` loop here, but using `Array.map()` might make this code more readable. What do you think about trying that?"

### 7. **Consider the Bigger Picture**

I try to look at the code changes within the larger context of the project. Is this change aligned with the **project’s goals**? Is it consistent with the **long-term architecture** and **design patterns**? Is the solution scalable and maintainable as the system grows?

- **Questions I ask myself**:
    
    - Does this code align with the **overall architecture**?
    - Is it **scalable** for future features or changes?
    - Does it affect any **existing functionality** or **other components** of the system?
- **Example**: "I see that you’ve hardcoded a lot of configurations directly into this file. For scalability, I suggest moving this to a configuration file or environment variables."

### 8. **Keep It Timely**

I try to ensure that code reviews are **timely** and don’t delay the development process. Waiting too long to provide feedback can slow down the development cycle, so I aim to give feedback promptly (typically within 1-2 business days).

- **How I do it**:
    
    - **Clear and concise feedback**: I focus on the most important feedback and avoid getting lost in small nit-picks unless they are critical.
    - **Set expectations**: I communicate if something will take longer to review, especially if the changes are large or complex.
- **Example**: "I’ll review the code tomorrow. In the meantime, feel free to continue testing the new feature locally or with a staging environment."

### 9. **Follow Up After Changes**

Once the changes are made, I ensure that **all feedback has been addressed** and that the code has passed **all tests**. I do a final pass to make sure everything is good to go.

- **How I do it**:
    
    - **Re-review if necessary**: If major changes have been made, I’ll re-review to ensure the fixes address the issues correctly.
    - **Test before merging**: I always make sure the code is tested, either via automated tests or by manual testing in certain cases, before merging.
- **Example**: "I see you’ve fixed the API response time issue. The new solution looks good. Let’s run some final tests, and once everything passes, we can merge."
