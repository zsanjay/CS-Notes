Package the service as a (Docker) container image and deploy each service instance as a container

## Examples

Docker is becoming an extremely popular way of packaging and deploying services. Each service is packaged as a Docker image and each service instance is a Docker container. There are several Docker clustering frameworks including:

- [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)
- [Marathon/Mesos](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/)
- [Amazon EC2 Container Service](http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)

## Resulting context

The benefits of this approach include:

- It is straightforward to scale up and down a service by changing the number of container instances.
- The container encapsulates the details of the technology used to build the service. All services are, for example, started and stopped in exactly the same way.
- Each service instance is isolated
- A container imposes limits on the CPU and memory consumed by a service instance
- Containers are extremely fast to build and start. For example, itâ€™s 100x faster to package an application as a Docker container than it is to package it as an AMI. Docker containers also start much faster than a VM since only the application process starts rather than an entire OS.

The drawbacks of this approach include:

- The infrastructure for deploying containers is not as rich as the infrastructure for deploying virtual machines.
