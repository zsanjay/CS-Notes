T,F and NG are all about [[factual information]] in the passage.

**True** - the statement agrees with the information.

**False** -  the statement contradicts (opposite) the information

**Not Given** : there is not information on this.

	Note - it is not about matching the sentence, it is about meaning of the question and the statement in the passage should be same.

	Example 1:

Passage:

**The majority** of people who graduated university found it difficult to get a job.


Question:

After finishing their tertiary (university) education, **all people** had difficulties to find employment.

Ans : False

	Example 2:

**Passage:**

The charity raises money to pay for education and the daily needs of poor people.

**Question:**

The charity spends **more (opposite of more is less) of the money** raised on schooling for poor people than on their daily requirements.

Ans: Not Given

	Example 3:

Passage:

**Just** **over 400 million** acres of land **is being used** (Present Continuous) for agricultural in America.

Question:

At present (Present tense), in America, **about 400 million** acres of land is **allocated** for agriculture.


Ans :  True

Note- About has same meaning as Just over or Just under.


Tips:

1. Spend time reading and analysing the question statement.
2. You are not trying the match keywords. You must match meaning.
3. Paraphrases
4. Look out for common traps.(comparisons  all/ some/majority).
5. True False Not Given and Yes No Not Given use the same techniques.
6. Answers come in order.
7. Keep your eye on the next question.(if the question is not given never read the whole passage to find the particular question instead look for the next question).
8. Remember the meaning of False / No is the information is opposite.
9. If the question is True False Not Given you can't write Yes/No.
10. You can write a letter instead of a word i.e. T for True.

**Homework**

P: By the second half of the 17th century, coffee had found its way to Europe.
Q. Coffee arrived in Europe after the 17th century.

Ans:  False. Well, the first half is at the beginning of the 17th century to the middle of the 17th century. The second half is from the middle of the 17th century to the end of the 17th century. So, the second half of the 17th century is still inside the 17th century.
However, the question statement says after the 17th century. So, this is wrong. If we know the statement is incorrect or opposite, the answer is FALSE.
